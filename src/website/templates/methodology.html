        <p class="card-text">
          Our dataset is built by aggregating job postings from <strong>Indeed.com.</strong>
          We utilized the <code class="bg-light px-1 rounded">JobSpy</code> library to scrape real-time job listings.
          Additionally, we implemented custom <strong>Selenium</strong> scripts to handle dynamic content and ensure a
          comprehensive dataset.
          The raw data includes job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and full job descriptions.

        <p class="card-text">
          Raw data was processed using <strong>Pandas</strong> to handle missing values, normalize salary formats, and
          standardize location names.
          We employed <strong>spaCy</strong> for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key skills and
          technologies from unstructured job descriptions.
          This allowed us to create a structured "skills" column for every job posting, enabling precise filtering and
          analysis.

        <p class="card-text">
          The core of our "Resume Match" feature is a content-based recommendation model built with
          <strong>scikit-learn</strong>.
          It matches your resume to job postings using a weighted scoring algorithm:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush mb-3">
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>TF-IDF Vectorization (55% weight):</strong> We convert both your resume and job descriptions (Title
            + Skills + Description) into numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and compare them using cosine similarity. This
            captures the textual similarity between your profile and the job.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Skill Overlap (35% weight):</strong> We calculate the percentage of required job skills that are
            present in your resume. This ensures you have the specific technical competencies requested.
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            <strong>Experience Bonus (10% weight):</strong> We extract years of experience from both texts and apply a
            bonus score if your experience level closely matches the job requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="card-text text-muted fst-italic">
          Final Score = (0.55 × TF-IDF) + (0.35 × Skill Score) + (0.10 × Experience Bonus)
