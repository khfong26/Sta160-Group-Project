            Our project aims to conduct an analysis of the job market across the states of 
            <strong>California, New York, and Texas</strong>. Using data scraped from 
            <strong>Indeed.com</strong>, we analyzed job postings based on factors such as role, 
            location, salary ranges, and skillsets. From our scraped data, we identified 
            patterns and overall trends across these roles.

            Our analysis was built on a complete data pipeline that scrapes raw job listings 
            from Indeed.com, cleans the raw CSV files into processed CSV files, and loads it 
            onto our dashboard, with a recommendation model page to give users the best 
            fitting jobs based on their resumes. The dashboard was developed using 
            <strong>Flask, HTML / CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, and allows users to interact 
            with our findings and explore important information for each role. Altogether, our project gives a comprehensive overview of the job market between 
            the three states, specifically focusing on roles related to statistics.

            Naturally, as students about to enter the workforce, our group wanted to focus on a topic 
            related to all of our studies. All members of our group are Statistics majors, 
            so we specifically looked at roles relating to Statistics, such as 
            <strong>Data Analysts, Software Engineers, and Machine Learning Engineers</strong>.

            By looking at various jobs across different regions in the United States, our group 
            wanted to understand the different demands, compensations, and skillsets that varied 
            throughout these regions and adjacent roles. Furthermore, to add a component of 
            interactivity to the website, we wanted to allow general users to submit their 
            resumes to get a sample of recommended job postings tailored to their qualifications.

            This project not only allowed us to apply statistical methods, data cleaning, 
            and web scraping to make an interactive dashboard, but also helped us answer an 
            important practical question that we must all face very soon:
