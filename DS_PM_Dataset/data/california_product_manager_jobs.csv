We are globally recognized both for our open source tools (Terragrunt, Terratest, cloud-nuke) used by thousands of companies from startups to Fortune 500s, and our thought leadership on how DevOps should be done.</p><p>

If you&rsquo;ve seen this pattern before and similarly see the potential, this could be the perfect opportunity for you.</p><p>
We are seeking a strategic, hands-on Head of Product to own the unified vision and execution for our product management (and to an extent, product marketing) functions. This is not a management and delegation role, this is a in-the-weeds product role with both strategic and operational components.

Product Marketing</b></p><ul><li><p>
The company does not, for now, have a dedicated product marketing headcount, so that responsibility primarily will fall with the product lead, to be shared with our head of marketing.</p></li><li><p>
Design, implement, and own the company&rsquo;s PLG strategy, creating seamless and intuitive pathways for open-source users to discover, try, and buy our commercial products.</p></li><li><p>
Develop compelling product positioning, messaging, and go-to-market strategies that resonate deeply with our technical audience, from individual developers to enterprise decision-makers.</p></li><li><p>

Rhythms is building the AI business execution system that enables enterprises to become AI-native&mdash;fundamentally rethinking how organizations operate, execute, and scale.</p><p>
We're founded by entrepreneurs who built and sold Chronus (acquired by PE) and Ally.io (acquired by Microsoft). We've raised a $26M seed round from top investors including GreenOaks, Madrona, and Accel, alongside CXOs from global technology leaders&mdash;earning GeekWire's 2024 Deal of the Year and named a 2025 AI Innovation of the Year finalist.</p><p>
Rhythms transform how enterprises become AI-native by connecting strategic planning and OKRs directly to day-to-day execution and real-time progress tracking. Built on multi-agent AI architecture, our platform connects with Slack, Teams, Jira, Linear, and other daily tools to automate operational workflows, surface predictive insights and risks, eliminate manual status updates, and build organizational memory that grows smarter over time. Enterprise customers choose us because we're making agentic AI reliable enough to run critical business operations.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
The Role</b></h2><p>
You'll be our first PM hire, working directly with the founder to help with product execution across our entire platform. This means you'll touch everything - from writing specs and prompts, to conducting user research, to managing customer rollouts and validation.</p><p>
We're in the early stages - this is not a scale-up role. This is a &quot;roll up your sleeves and build something from scratch&quot; role.</p><p><b>
You'll Own:</b></p><ul><li><p><b>
Execution:</b> Writing PRDs, specs, and AI prompts (the new PRDs) that engineering can run with</p></li><li><p><b>

4-7+ years as a PM, ideally at early-stage startups or in ambiguous environments</p></li><li><p>
You've shipped products where you had to figure out what to build, not just execute a roadmap</p></li><li><p>
Comfortable working in 0 1 environments where things change weekly</p></li></ul><p><b>
AI-First Mindset:</b></p><ul><li><p>
You lead with AI in how you work (using AI tools to be more productive) AND how you think about product (building AI-native features)</p></li><li><p>
You can write effective AI prompts - this is becoming core to how we spec and build</p></li><li><p>
Able to use AI assistants to prototype features</p></li></ul><p><b>
Technical Fluency:</b></p><ul><li><p>
You don't need to code, but you understand enough technology to have intelligent conversations with engineers</p></li><li><p>
Can grasp technical concepts like LLM reasoning, context window, MCP&hellip;.</p></li></ul><p><b>
Customer-Obsessed:</b></p><ul><li><p>
Extraordinary drive to solve customer problems - you genuinely care about making their lives better</p></li><li><p>
Comfortable being customer-facing: calls, demos, relationship management</p></li><li><p>
Strong partner to sales</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Cultural Fit (Non-Negotiables):</b></h2><ul><li><p><b>

Opportunity to define how we do product management as we scale and turn Rhythms into a decacorn</p></li><li><p>
High ownership and autonomy - we trust people to run with things</p></li><li><p>
Distributed team (Seattle, SF, Hyderabad, Chennai) - remote-friendly</p></li><li><p>
Competitive equity and salary for early-stage startup</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p>

Shape the culture and practice of product management at FOX Sports.</div></li><li><div>
Work at the intersection of live sports, fan communities, and emerging technology.</div></li><li><div>
