After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn&rsquo;t work together.<br>
<br>
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

Today&rsquo;s businesses face complex global challenges that demand more than conventional consulting services. Andersen Consulting offers a seamless, multidimensional approach that combines expertise in business transformation, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, sustainability, and digital strategy with Andersen Global&rsquo;s established tax and legal capabilities. This integration of emerging technologies positions Andersen Consulting as the partner of choice in the $1 trillion consulting industry.</div>
The Role:
<div>
We're looking for an AI Engineer to own end-to-end technical implementation of data pipelines, workflows, and applications that power machine learning and GenAI workloads on Palantir's Foundry and AIP platforms.

We understand narrow, well-defined job responsibilities work for some people. If you prefer highly structured roles, this position may not fit.

We expect you to:</div><ul><li>
Come ready to deliver your best work and influence your team to do the same</li><li>
Lead Foundry and AIP implementations from scoping through production deployment with exceptional quality</li><li>

Develop and orchestrate AIP agents that solve concrete customer problems in production environments</li><li>
Manage client relationships and coordinate cross-functional programs, acting as the primary technical owner</li><li><div><ul><li><div>
</div></li></ul></div></li></ul>
The Requirements:
<div>
To be successfully considered for this role, you will have:</div><ul><li>
10 years of technical experience delivering production solutions</li><li>
5 years of hands-on experience building solutions on Palantir Foundry and AIP platforms</li><li>
Track record leading multiple successful Foundry implementations from discovery through production</li><li>

Deep experience building solutions with LLMs and comprehensive understanding of the GenAI ecosystem</li><li>
Strong communication skills to bridge technical and business stakeholders effectively</li></ul><div>
It would also be beneficial if you have:</div><ul><li>
Experience with advanced ontology design, governance frameworks, and building complex multi-layered workflows</li><li>
Demonstrated ability to context-switch rapidly and unblock challenging technical obstacles across dispersed teams</li><li>
Troubleshooting expertise for production optimization and incident resolution</li><li>
Proven track record coordinating cross-functional programs and managing technical delivery across multiple workstreams</li><li>
Engineering mindset that prioritizes rapid, pragmatic decisions to improve performance, accelerate progress, and magnify impact, recognizing perfect is the enemy of good</li><li>
Industry domain expertise in finance, healthcare, or manufacturing</li></ul><div>
We&rsquo;re looking for a passionate, team oriented, experienced engineer who&rsquo;s self-motivated and loves technology. We expect you to do the best work of your life and influence those around you to do the same. We value humility and intellectual honesty in our engineers.

<br><br>
About the Role and You
<br><br>
<b>We're looking for a rare combination:</b> a data scientist who thinks like a strategist and a strategist who speaks fluent data. You fall in love with problems and quantify complex situations using math. This isn't a role about building models in isolation—it's about transforming how a business makes decisions, identifies opportunities, and drives growth. You'll be equal parts analyst, advisor, and architect of our strategic direction.
<br><br>
What You'll Do
<br><br>
You'll sit at the intersection of data and strategy, turning complex business challenges into quantifiable opportunities. This means diving deep into our numbers to surface insights that others miss, then translating those insights into actionable growth strategies. You'll work directly with leadership to shape major business decisions, from market expansion and pricing strategy to resource allocation and competitive positioning.
<br>Your day-to-day will involve identifying the right questions to ask before anyone else thinks to ask them, building the analytical frameworks to answer those questions, and presenting recommendations that fundamentally shift how we operate. You'll own strategic initiatives from conception through execution, measuring impact and iterating as you go. You’ll travel to client sites as needed.
<br><br>
What We're Looking For
<br><br>
<b>The Strategic Mindset:</b> You naturally think several moves ahead. You understand business models, competitive dynamics, and growth levers. You can walk into a room with executives and hold your own in discussions about market strategy, unit economics, and long-term planning. You've seen how businesses succeed and fail, and you know how to spot the difference.
<br><b>The Technical Depth:</b> You're genuinely strong in quantitative methods—statistics, predictive modeling, optimization, experimental design. You can wrangle messy data, build robust analyses, and know when a sophisticated model is needed versus when a simple calculation will do. Python, R, SQL are second nature to you.
<br><b>The Translation Layer:</b> You can explain complex analytical concepts to non-technical stakeholders without dumbing them down. You know how to build conviction around data-driven recommendations and can defend your methodology when challenged. You make the quantitative accessible and actionable.
<br><b>The Business Acumen:</b> You understand P&Ls, growth metrics, customer economics, and operational levers. You've worked closely enough with business teams to know what keeps them up at night and how your analyses can help them sleep better.
<br><br>
Requirements
<br>5+ years of experience in analytical roles with increasing strategic responsibility
<br>Strong foundation in statistics, machine learning, and quantitative analysis
<br>Demonstrated experience influencing business strategy through data
<br>Track record of identifying and driving growth opportunities
<br>Excellent communication skills with technical and executive audiences
<br>Proficiency in modern data science tools and languages
<br>Understanding of business finance and growth frameworks
<br>Ideal Background
<br><br>
You might come from management consulting with deep analytical chops, strategic roles at high-growth companies, corporate strategy teams with hands-on data work, or data science roles where you've grown into strategic advisory. What matters most is that you've successfully used data to change how businesses operate and grow.
<br><br>
What Success Looks Like
<br><br>
In your first year, you'll have identified three major strategic opportunities we weren't seeing before, built the analytical infrastructure to evaluate them rigorously, and driven at least one to implementation with measurable business impact. You'll have become a trusted advisor to leadership and the person they turn to when facing the company's thorniest strategic questions.
<br><br>
<b>The annual salary for this role ranges from:</b> $170,000 to $225,000 USD + benefits + bonus. Actual compensation packages are determined by evaluating a wide array of factors unique to each candidate, including but not limited to geographic location, skill set, years and depth of experience, education, certifications, cost of labor and internal equity.

We&rsquo;re deliberate about hiring.</b></h2><p>
A small team of exceptional people, working hard on a problem they care about, will always beat a larger, less focused team.That intensity means this isn&rsquo;t a normal role, but it also means you&rsquo;ll move faster than anywhere else.</p><p><b>
Examples:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><i>
Serafin</i></b> joined 6 months ago and built our entire product notetaker, competing with whole companies, including research, model training, and product development.</p></li><li><p><b><i>
Joey</i></b> joined 7 months ago and built our human data platform for model training and evals.</p></li><li><p><b><i>

What we promise</b></h2><p>
Most fast-growing startups fall into traps: overhiring, losing focus, acting like big companies.</p><p>
We believe <b>small, exceptional, high-performing teams</b> are the future.</p><ul><li><p>
No bureaucracy</p></li><li><p>
No processes that slow decisions</p></li><li><p>

OpenAI’s User Operations organization is building the data and intelligence layer behind AI-assisted operations — the systems that decide when automation should help users, when humans should step in, and how both improve over time. Our flagship platform is transforming customer support into a model for “agent-first” operations across OpenAI.
<br><br>
About the Role
<br><br>
As a Data Scientist on User Operations, you’ll design the models, metrics, and experimentation frameworks that power OpenAI’s human-AI collaboration loop. You’ll build systems that measure quality, optimize automation, and turn operational data into insights that improve product and user experience at scale. You’ll partner closely with Support Automation Engineering, Product, and Data Engineering to ensure our data systems are production-grade, trusted, and impactful.
<br><br>
This role is based in San Francisco or New York City. We use a hybrid work model of three days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.
<br><br>
Why it matters
<br><br>
Every conversation users have with OpenAI products produces signals about how humans and AI interact. User Ops Data Science turns those signals into insights that shape how we support users today and design agentic systems for tomorrow. This is a unique opportunity to help define how AI collaboration at scale is measured and improved inside OpenAI.
<br><br>
<b>In this role, you will:</b><br>
Build and own metrics, classifiers, and data pipelines that determine automation eligibility, effectiveness, and guardrails.
<br><br>
Design and evaluate experiments that quantify the impact of automation and AI systems on user outcomes like resolution quality and satisfaction.
<br><br>
Develop predictive and statistical models that improve how OpenAI’s support systems automate, measure, and learn from user interactions.
<br><br>
Partner with engineering and product teams to create feedback loops that continuously improve our AI agents and knowledge systems.
<br><br>
Translate complex data into clear, actionable insights for leadership and cross-functional stakeholders.
<br><br>
Develop and socialize dashboards, applications, and other ways of enabling the team and company to answer product data questions in a self-serve way
<br><br>
Contribute to establishing data science standards and best practices in an AI-native operations environment.
<br><br>
Partner with other data scientists across the company to share knowledge and continually synthesize learnings across the organization
<br><br>
<b>You might thrive in this role if you have:</b><br>
10+ years of experience in data science roles within product or technology organizations.
<br><br>
Expertise in statistics and causal inference, applied in both experimentation and observational causal inference studies.
<br><br>
Expert-level SQL and proficiency in Python for analytics, modeling, and experimentation.
<br><br>
Proven experience designing and interpreting experiments and making statistically sound recommendations.
<br><br>
Experience building data systems or pipelines that power production workflows or ML-based decisioning.
<br><br>
Experience developing and extracting insights from business intelligence tools, such as Mode, Tableau, and Looker.
<br><br>
Strategic and impact-driven mindset, capable of translating complex business problems into actionable frameworks.
<br><br>
Ability to build relationships with diverse stakeholders and cultivate strong partnerships.
<br><br>
Strong communication skills, including the ability to bridge technical and non-technical stakeholders and collaborate across various functions to ensure business impact.
<br><br>
Ability to operate effectively in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment with limited structure.
<br><br>
Strong communication skills and the ability to translate complex data into stories for non-technical partners.
<br><br>
<b>Nice-to-haves:</b><br>

Eagle</b> is an AI holding company with a simple mission: bolster American resilience by creating the next-gen engineering services firm.</p><p><br>
Today American infrastructure faces no shortage of challenges &mdash; from natural disaster risk and climate change to outright age and deterioration.<br>
<br>
The problem is that the way we design infrastructure is stuck in the past.<br>
<br>
Engineers today spend most of their time bogged down in documentation, clunky CAD software, and manual workflows &mdash; acting more like back-office admin than inventive builders.
<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re on a mission to change that.<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re acquiring and partnering with the best engineering design firms &mdash; civil, structural, environmental, MEP, and more &mdash; to embed AI at the core of their operations and create the engineering firm of the future.</p><p><b><br>
About the role</b><br>
We&rsquo;re hiring <b>Applied AI Engineers</b> who will work directly with customer executives, operators, and technical teams to define and deliver high-impact AI systems. We don't build prototypes or laboratory projects- you&rsquo;ll design, build, and ship production-grade AI agents and workflows that drive millions in business value for customers.<br>
<br>
Our Applied AI Engineers:</p><ul><li><p><b>
Shape the AI vision</b>: Collaborate with customer stakeholders to define their long-term AI strategy and transformation roadmap.</p></li><li><p><b>
Identify high-leverage use cases</b>: Work backwards from the long-term vision to surface and prioritize specific AI applications that connect our ambition to measurable business value.</p></li><li><p><b>
Ship real products</b>: Rapidly build and deploy AI solutions that work in the wild, with real users and real data.</p></li><li><p><b>
Advance our core product</b>: Encode the lessons from our customer engagements in our Eagle platform, consistently contributing new features, patterns, and abstractions.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What we&rsquo;re looking for</b></p><ul><li><p><b>
AI-nativeness:</b> You're excited about the potential for AI to transform businesses and want to play a hands-on role in bringing frontier technology into critical institutions.</p></li><li><p><b>
Being generative and collaborative:</b> You love constantly jamming on new &ldquo;what if&rdquo; ideas with teammates and partners.</p></li><li><p><b>
Extreme ownership</b>: You&rsquo;re willing to jump in and love being the one on the hook. You aren&rsquo;t going to wait to be pointed at a task&mdash;you&rsquo;re going to identify what you think we should do next, and then do it.</p></li><li><p><b>
Execution excellence and speed</b>: You can build stuff in messy environments and know how to get code written and shipped quickly. You can hold the balance of speed and quality and know when to push the pace vs. when to slow down.</p></li><li><p><b>
Customer-obsession and respect</b>: You&rsquo;re motivated by understanding customer pain points and iterating directly with end users to deliver wins quickly.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Bonus if you have</b></p><ul><li><p>
Hands-on experience with <b>LLM tooling</b> (LangGraph, Mastra, Agents SDK, etc).</p></li><li><p>
Built and deployed <b>production LLM-powered systems</b> (tool use, RAG pipelines, multi-step agents, human-in-the-loop, etc).</p></li><li><p>
Strong technical foundations in Python/TypeScript, cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) and DevOps tooling.</p></li><li><p>

<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.</p>

To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals.

What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h3>
<p>
We're looking for an experienced Senior Director of Analytics to work on Supply Chain &amp; Operations and Product Development efforts to deliver on our promise of quality food and timely delivery of our subscription boxes to our customers. This role also enables removing blindspots in our food and the box journey to customer and enrich our understanding in the inputs to output metrics. You will be responsible for synthesizing a wide-variety of data sources by working with external and internal partners. You'll have the opportunity to build upon our existing foundation to take the foundation we have in place today and evolve it effectively with the business to ensure we continue to design seamless and deeply personalized experiences in the box journey..</p>
<p>
In the role, you'll partner closely with groups across the business in Product, Engineering, CX, Operations, Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, Data Scientists and other Analysts to build a best-in-class experiment design and insight generation engine.</p>
<p>
We need a leader who can share an inspiring vision, execute by bringing everyone on to the execution path, bring clarity and momentum and work with internal and external partners to remove blindspots in product journey to customer. This is the competitive edge for DTC business. This helps build feedback loops to what future products to launch, calibrate existing recipes, personalize fulfillment, identify margin opportunities and improve stickiness of our product with customers. As we continue to grow operationally for new products, product lines, etc. we'd need more strategic leadership to understand intricacies and nuances with external partners as well</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Supply Chain Specialists&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<p><b>
How You'll Make An Impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Define and execute the analytics vision, strategy, and roadmap for supply chain and product development, with clear goals, priorities, and stakeholder communication.</li>
<li>Build, lead, and mentor a high-impact Analytics team, providing coaching, feedback, and career development to drive long-term success.</li>

<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Belonging Philosophy:</b></h3>
<p>
At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.</p>
<p>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.</p>
<p>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

A day in the life<br>
We're using advanced approaches such as foundation models to connect information about our videos and customers from a variety of information sources, acquiring and processing data sets on a scale that only a few companies in the world can match. This will enable us to recommend titles effectively, even when we don't have a large behavioral signal (to tackle the cold-start title problem). It will also allow us to find our customer's niche interests, helping them discover groups of titles that they didn't even know existed. We are looking for creative &amp; customer obsessed machine learning scientists who can apply the latest research, state of the art algorithms and ML to build highly scalable page personalization solutions. You'll be a research leader in the space and a hands-on ML practitioner, guiding and collaborating with talented teams of engineers and scientists and senior leaders in the Prime Video organization. You will also have the opportunity to publish your research at internal and external conferences.
