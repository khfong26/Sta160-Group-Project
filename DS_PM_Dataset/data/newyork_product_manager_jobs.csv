Founded by attorneys and technologists, Qumis delivers law-firm-grade coverage analysis with the speed and scalability of AI. Our customers include some of the largest insurance brokerages and carriers in the world, and we&rsquo;re scaling with venture capital from top tier funds fueling our fast growth. Help us build the most accurate insightful AI for insurance.</p><p><b>
The Role</b></p><p>
We&rsquo;re hiring our first Product Manager to join our founding team.

As Founding PM, you&rsquo;ll work directly with the CEO, CTO, and founding engineers to shape the roadmap, turn customer insights into product strategy, and ship features that become the new standard for how insurance knowledge work gets done.

Applecart</b> is the leading technology company that C-suites rely on to reach business-critical decision makers. The most important decisions are made by the hardest people to reach and influence.

Decision makers are informed by what they read, learn from advisors, hear from colleagues, and discuss with family and friends. To break through to them, you must reach them through the only channel that really moves them: those they know and trust.

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>
<br>
We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h2><p>
We&rsquo;re looking for a Senior Product Manager to join Valon&rsquo;s team focused on new initiatives and AI. The team is currently building AI agents and applications using LLMs on top of our mortgage servicing platform. Across servicing operations, there&rsquo;s a significant amount of repetitive work that cannot be easily automated with existing RPA or deterministic logic. We&rsquo;re developing AI products that eliminate the manual work required to complete these tasks. You&rsquo;ll collaborate with some of our most experienced engineers, taking MVP prototypes with proven customer demand and scaling them into production-ready products on our SaaS platform. This is a high-visibility role with significant growth potential and is a core part of Valon&rsquo;s company strategy over the next 12&ndash;24 months.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>

We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations.

This role will balance competing interests across those end customers through developing complex solutions for severely delinquent and legally impacted mortgages. You will have the opportunity to launch a number of new products from scratch, and scale them as we grow the number of loans on the platform. You will work closely with a team of engineers, deployment strategists, product operations, data analysis, and design.

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>
<br>
We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

A day in the life<br>
As the Sr. Product Manager for Identity and Household Management, your day is a dynamic mix of strategy, problem-solving, and cross-functional collaboration.

About the team<br>
The Identity and Household Management Team builds the foundational experiences that shape how users access, personalize, and share music across devices. We solve multi-user, multi-device challenges at scale &mdash; from kids discovering their favorite songs on a tablet, to parents using Alexa to play dinner playlists, to teens curating their own personalized feeds.<br>
<br>
