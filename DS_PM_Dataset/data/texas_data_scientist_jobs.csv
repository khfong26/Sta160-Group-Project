Skills/Experiences</b></p><p><b>
Technical Foundation</b></p><p>
A strong foundation in Python is essential, as it's central to Databricks work. The candidate should be comfortable with data manipulation libraries like pandas and NumPy, and ideally have some exposure to PySpark for distributed computing. SQL proficiency is non-negotiable given our complex data landscape&mdash;they need to write efficient queries across multiple sources. Some exposure to machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, XGBoost, or similar) is valuable, though not necessarily production-level expertise.</p><p><b>
Databricks &amp; Data Platform Experience</b></p><p>
This is where we can differentiate our internship. Candidates with hands-on Databricks experience (Delta Lake, MLflow, notebooks) are ideal, but rare for interns. More realistically, we should look for someone who understands data lakehouse concepts, has worked with distributed data platforms, or has completed relevant projects using cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). Experience with data versioning and experiment tracking is a plus.</p><p><b>
Agentic AI &amp; LLM Fundamentals</b></p><p>
Given our emerging agentic platform focus, we should seek candidates who understand LLM basics and have tinkered with frameworks like LangChain or similar. They don't need to be experts, but should understand retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and agent orchestration concepts. Practical experience building simple agents or working with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) demonstrates genuine interest and ability to contribute immediately to our work.</p><p><b>
Data Engineering Mindset</b></p><p>
Our complex, maturing data landscape means interns need to think beyond analysis. They should understand data quality, lineage, and governance concepts. Experience with data pipelines, ETL/ELT concepts, and schema management is valuable. They should be comfortable working with messy, incomplete data and thinking through data integration challenges rather than expecting pristine, pre-processed datasets.</p><p><b>
Nice-to-Have Elements</b></p><p>
Healthcare or insurance domain knowledge (understanding claims processing, member data, actuarial concepts) gives them immediate context for our work. Familiarity with data governance frameworks and tools is valuable given our maturing landscape. Some exposure to DevOps or MLOps thinking shows they understand the path from model to production in our environment. Any contribution to open-source projects or personal data science projects demonstrates initiative.</p><p>

About Us</b></p><p></p><p>
Senseye is a NeuroTechnology Company in Austin, TX on the cusp of revolutionizing Mental Health. Over the past 6 years we have invested millions of dollars in R&amp;D to build our platform allowing us to measure cognitive activity via the eye through mobile phones. Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p><b>

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</div></li><li><div>
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</div></li><li><div>

The Roku Culture</b></h3>
<p>
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams. We're independent thinkers with big ideas who act boldly, move fast and accomplish extraordinary things through collaboration and trust. In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.</p>
<p>
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p>
