About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p></p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p></p><p><b>
Reducto</b><b> breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content.</b> This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>

Skills/Experiences</b></p><p><b>
Technical Foundation</b></p><p>
A strong foundation in Python is essential, as it's central to Databricks work. The candidate should be comfortable with data manipulation libraries like pandas and NumPy, and ideally have some exposure to PySpark for distributed computing. SQL proficiency is non-negotiable given our complex data landscape&mdash;they need to write efficient queries across multiple sources. Some exposure to machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, XGBoost, or similar) is valuable, though not necessarily production-level expertise.</p><p><b>
Databricks &amp; Data Platform Experience</b></p><p>
This is where we can differentiate our internship. Candidates with hands-on Databricks experience (Delta Lake, MLflow, notebooks) are ideal, but rare for interns. More realistically, we should look for someone who understands data lakehouse concepts, has worked with distributed data platforms, or has completed relevant projects using cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). Experience with data versioning and experiment tracking is a plus.</p><p><b>
Agentic AI &amp; LLM Fundamentals</b></p><p>
Given our emerging agentic platform focus, we should seek candidates who understand LLM basics and have tinkered with frameworks like LangChain or similar. They don't need to be experts, but should understand retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, and agent orchestration concepts. Practical experience building simple agents or working with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) demonstrates genuine interest and ability to contribute immediately to our work.</p><p><b>
Data Engineering Mindset</b></p><p>
Our complex, maturing data landscape means interns need to think beyond analysis. They should understand data quality, lineage, and governance concepts. Experience with data pipelines, ETL/ELT concepts, and schema management is valuable. They should be comfortable working with messy, incomplete data and thinking through data integration challenges rather than expecting pristine, pre-processed datasets.</p><p><b>
Nice-to-Have Elements</b></p><p>
Healthcare or insurance domain knowledge (understanding claims processing, member data, actuarial concepts) gives them immediate context for our work. Familiarity with data governance frameworks and tools is valuable given our maturing landscape. Some exposure to DevOps or MLOps thinking shows they understand the path from model to production in our environment. Any contribution to open-source projects or personal data science projects demonstrates initiative.</p><p>

The team enjoys the duality of solving humongous research and engineering problems, while remaining focused on very concrete shorter-term breakthroughs. We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.</p>
<p>
We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is <i>truly</i> saying.</p>

We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee &amp; Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.</p><p></p><p><br>
Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.</p><p></p><p><br>
This role is an <b><i>in-house mathematician</i></b> role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.</p><p></p><p><br>
The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.</p><p></p><p><br>
Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.</p><p></p><p><br>

About the opportunity:</b></p><p>
Jerry is looking for a <b>Data scientist</b> to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years &mdash; scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company&rsquo;s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science &amp; analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.</p><p></p><p>
Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible &ndash; insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc &ndash; a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we&rsquo;ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot &amp; voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.</p><p></p><p><b>
Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</div></li><li><div>
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</div></li><li><div>
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Preferred experience:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline</div></li><li><div>
1+ years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis</div></li><li><div>
High level of comfort with SQL or Python</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Who you are:</b></p><ul><li><div>
You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles</div></li><li><div>
You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company&rsquo;s C-suite</div></li><li><div>

<br>
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

The Annapurna Labs team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) builds AWS Neuron, the software development kit used to accelerate deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon&rsquo;s custom machine learning accelerators, Inferentia and Trainium.<br>
<br>
The AWS Neuron SDK, developed by the Annapurna Labs team at AWS, is the backbone for accelerating deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon's Inferentia and Trainium ML accelerators. This comprehensive toolkit includes an ML compiler, runtime, and application framework that seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and JAX enabling unparalleled ML inference and training performance.<br>
<br>
The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team is at the forefront of running a wide range of models and supporting novel architecture alongside maximizing their performance for AWS's custom ML accelerators. Working across the stack from PyTorch till the hardware-software boundary, our engineers build systematic infrastructure, innovate new methods and create high-performance kernels for ML functions, ensuring every compute unit is fine tuned for optimal performance for our customers' demanding workloads. We combine deep hardware knowledge with ML expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI acceleration.<br>
<br>
As part of the broader Neuron organization, our team works across multiple technology layers - from frameworks and kernels and collaborate with compiler to runtime and collectives. We not only optimize current performance but also contribute to future architecture designs, working closely with customers to enable their models and ensure optimal performance. This role offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and distributed architectures, where you'll help shape the future of AI acceleration technology<br>
<br>
You will architect and implement business critical features, and mentor a brilliant team of experienced engineers. We operate in spaces that are very large, yet our teams remain small and agile. There is no blueprint. We're inventing. We're experimenting. It is a very unique learning culture. The team works closely with customers on their model enablement, providing direct support and optimization expertise to ensure their machine learning workloads achieve optimal performance on AWS ML accelerators. The team collaborates with open source ecosystems to provide seamless integration and bring peak performance at scale for customers and developers.<br>
<br>
This role is responsible for development, enablement and performance tuning of a wide variety of LLM model families, including massive scale large language models like the Llama family, DeepSeek and beyond. The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team works side by side with compiler engineers and runtime engineers to create, build and tune distributed inference solutions with Trainium and Inferentia. Experience optimizing inference performance for both latency and throughput on such large models across the stack from system level optimizations through to Pytorch or JAX is a must have.

As part of the AWS Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon&rsquo;s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day-to-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers&rsquo; businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges.

The Team<br>
<br>
Just Walk Out (JWO) is a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout&mdash;you just grab and go! Customers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take what they want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals and grocery essentials, and go!<br>
<br>
Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out Technology, which automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you&rsquo;re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we&rsquo;ll charge your account and send you a receipt. Check it out at amazon.com/go. Designed and custom-built by Amazonians, our Just Walk Out Technology uses a variety of technologies including computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA! Our goal is to be Earths&rsquo; most customer centric company and we are just getting started. We need people who want to join an ambitious program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.<br>
<br>
Key job responsibilities<br>
Everyone on the team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that&rsquo;s more startup than big company. We&rsquo;ll need to tackle problems that span a variety of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, real-time and distributed systems.
<br>
<br>
As an Applied Scientist, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other scientists. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and given the size of this initiative, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon in different locations. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that&rsquo;s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that, frankly, haven&rsquo;t been solved at scale before - anywhere. Along the way, we guarantee that you&rsquo;ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.<br>
<br>
A key focus of this role will be developing and implementing advanced visual reasoning systems that can understand complex spatial relationships and object interactions in real-time. You'll work on designing autonomous AI agents that can make intelligent decisions based on visual inputs, understand customer behavior patterns, and adapt to dynamic retail environments. This includes developing systems that can perform complex scene understanding, reason about object permanence, and predict customer intentions through visual cues.<br>
