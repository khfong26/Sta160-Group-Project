<p>
Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.</p>
<p>
Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 19 state partners &ndash; big and small, red and blue &ndash; and covers more than 45% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get hundreds of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners &ndash; from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.</p>

<br>
The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors, 100 minors, and 200 advanced degree programs offered across the University&rsquo;s 13 schools and colleges; over 15,000 undergraduates and over 6,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries.

<div><div><b>About the Syracuse area</b></div>
<div>Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.</div>

<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.<br>
<br>
To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.</p>
<p>
#LongLiveDogs</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h2>
<p>
At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the best experience, every time.</p>
<p>
Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers (humans and their best friends) with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>
You'll support a group of talented engineers and managers across &quot;pawds&quot; who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to have a direct hand in scaling the business, solving novel customer problems, and building strong relationships along the way.</p>
<p>
If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you.</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Acquisition Marketers&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How You'll Make An Impact</b></h2>
<ul><li>Guide the strategic evolution of core systems, establishing clear boundaries, leading migrations, and enabling resilient architecture that scales and adapts to business needs</li>
<li>Influence product and business strategy through deep understanding of our system and products by identifying risks, constraints and opportunities</li>
<li>Foster alignment across the organization by building trust between &quot;pawds&quot;, refining priorities and ensuring the engineering strategy supports customer and company goals</li>
<li>Partner closely with Staff engineers and other engineering leaders to steer and shape the organization</li>
<li>Assess and introduce new technologies thoughtfully through research, prototypes, written briefs and, most importantly, ensuring alignment with our strategy</li>
<li>Work with departments across the organization to ensure a cohesive experience across all of our digital and physical products for new customers</li>
<li>Continuously raise the bar for engineering excellence by modeling high standards, mentoring senior engineers, and spreading best practices across the org</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>We're Excited About You Because</b></h2>
<ul><li>You bring 10+ years of experience in software engineering, with deep and varied expertise designing and evolving systems at scale</li>
<li>You have led architectural initiatives that reshaped systems and made them more reliable, maintainable, and extensible</li>
<li>You've partnered closely with product on business strategy and have helped organizations balance short and long term strategy</li>
<li>You are able to succeed in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, naturally curious and proactive self-starter, constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and solutions</li>
<li>You thrive at working across teams, aligning people and systems, and driving impact beyond your immediate scope</li>

<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Belonging Philosophy:</b></h2>
<p>
At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.<br>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.<br>
<br>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
<br>
<br>
The Public Affairs division promotes the agency&rsquo;s key role in equipping all candidates and voters to power a fairer and more open democracy in New York City. We engage New Yorkers, inform them about elections, and boost their civic participation in the democratic process. Within Public Affairs, the Partnerships and Outreach unit works to build partnerships across the city to disseminate voting information, deliver accessible voter education, and conduct direct to voter outreach. The intention of this team&rsquo;s work is to create pathways for all New Yorkers to gain trustworthy and accessible information and education around voting and democracy. Only then can we authentically increase civic participation and mobilize our communities beyond just voting.
<br>
<br>
JOB DESCRIPTION
<br>
<br>
NYC Votes is an initiative of the New York City Campaign Finance Board (CFB), a nonpartisan, independent agency, that aims to inform New Yorkers about elections and boost their civic participation in the democratic process. We are seeking a Senior Outreach Manager to join our team. The Senior Outreach Manager will report to the Director of Partnerships and Outreach and will supervise the Field Coordinator, Outreach Coordinator, and other staff as the department grows. The work of this team supports the CFB&rsquo;s Charter mandate to increase participation of underrepresented voters in NYC elections, ensuring that all New Yorkers have the information and resources they need to participate in city, state, and federal elections and feel equipped and motivated to vote, no matter what barriers they may face.
<br>
<br>
Under our NYC Votes initiative, you would supervise direct voter engagement efforts in neighborhoods and with groups of voters who have historically had lower participation, often due to structural barriers. These efforts can include voter registration drives, community events, partnerships with local organizations and institutions to distribute voting information, door-to-door and site-based canvassing, texting, and other such activities. In addition, the outreach efforts you&rsquo;re leading may also highlight the benefits of the Matching Funds program, increasing awareness of the work that the CFB does under its other major Charter Mandate and how the agency&rsquo;s work helps strengthen democracy in NYC.
<br>
<br>
On the Outreach Team, your role will be to design and execute multi-modal outreach plans for each NYC election, typically rolling out three to six months ahead of each election. These plans will be created in close collaboration with the Director, ensuring they remain aligned with the larger unit and division strategic priorities. The Senior Outreach Manager will also serve as a key point person on cross-unit projects with other internal teams in public affairs. As a supervisor, you&rsquo;ll work with the other members of the unit to ensure plans accurately reflect realities on the ground and support the successful day-to-day execution of the activities and relationship management needed to reach unit goals and objectives.
<br>
<br>
Responsibilities include but are not limited to:

<div><div><div>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE BOARD
<br>
<br>
The Campaign Finance Board (NYCCFB) is a nonpartisan, independent city agency that empowers New Yorkers to have a greater impact on their elections. Our mission is to make local democracy more open, transparent, and equitable by removing barriers to participation.
<br>
<br>
We make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, meaningfully support candidates for city office, and run for office themselves. NYC Votes, our voter engagement initiative, meets people where they are to share trustworthy election information and help New Yorkers make a plan to vote. We publish the citywide Voter Guide, which delivers information about candidates directly to voters&rsquo; doors. Our public matching funds program ensures small contributions can make a big difference, allowing regular people to run for office by relying on the support of other regular people, not just wealthy donors and special interests. And we lift the veil on how candidates raise and spend money, increasing transparency and accountability in local government.
<br>
<br>
We believe that when every New Yorker is empowered to participate meaningfully in elections, candidates will better reflect the communities they serve, elected leaders will be more accountable to the public, and New Yorkers will have a democracy they can truly trust.
<br>

<li>Price metrics: Select and operationalize the right price metrics per segment (seats, usage, or outcomes) with thresholds, guardrails, and migration rules.</li>
<li>Rate cards &amp; bundles: Build rate cards (including for data products/APIs) and create bundling strategies that increase adoption and customer lifetime value while protecting realized price.</li>
<li>Pilots &amp; elasticity: Design and run new&#8209;logo and renewal pilots; analyze price achievement and realized price vs. target; scale what works.</li>

<li>Analytics &amp; controls: Design dashboards and controlling mechanisms to track pricing performance (override rates, win&#8209;rate by band, attach rate, time&#8209;to&#8209;quote, renewal uplift), identify areas for improvement, and measure the impact of packaging initiatives.</li>

<li>Partner with Sales Enablement to deliver value statements, objection playbooks, and ROI tools that make it easy to sell value instead of discounts.</li></ul><br>

You May be a Good Fit if:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>12+ years in B2B SaaS/Data pricing or product monetization with hands&#8209;on packaging ownership.</li>
<li>Proven ability to translate segmentation into packages and price metrics; practical Willingness&#8209;to&#8209;Pay and price&#8209;testing experience.</li>
<li>Strong analytical and financial acumen; comfort with CPQ/CRM/BI; familiarity with usage telemetry concepts.</li>

People who succeed at Recidiviz lead with kindness and humility, assume good intent, learn from failure, and fix problems when they see them.

<div><div><div>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE BOARD
<br>
<br>
The Campaign Finance Board is a nonpartisan, independent city agency that empowers New Yorkers to have a greater impact on their elections. Our mission is to make local democracy more open, transparent, and equitable by removing barriers to participation.
<br>
<br>
We make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, meaningfully support candidates for city office, and run for office themselves. NYC Votes, our voter engagement initiative, meets people where they are to share trustworthy election information and help New Yorkers make a plan to vote. We publish the citywide Voter Guide, which delivers information about candidates directly to voters&rsquo; doors. Our public matching funds program ensures small contributions can make a big difference, allowing regular people to run for office by relying on the support of other regular people, not just wealthy donors and special interests. And we lift the veil on how candidates raise and spend money, increasing transparency and accountability in local government.
<br>
<br>
We believe that when every New Yorker is empowered to participate meaningfully in elections, candidates will better reflect the communities they serve, elected leaders will be more accountable to the public, and New Yorkers will have a democracy they can truly trust.
<br>
<br>

<div><div><div>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE BOARD
<br>
<br>
The Campaign Finance Board is a nonpartisan, independent city agency that empowers New Yorkers to have a greater impact on their elections. Our mission is to make local democracy more open, transparent, and equitable by removing barriers to participation.
<br>
<br>
We make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, meaningfully support candidates for city office, and run for office themselves. NYC Votes, our voter engagement initiative, meets people where they are to share trustworthy election information and help New Yorkers make a plan to vote. We publish the citywide Voter Guide, which delivers information about candidates directly to voters&rsquo; doors. Our public matching funds program ensures small contributions can make a big difference, allowing regular people to run for office by relying on the support of other regular people, not just wealthy donors and special interests. And we lift the veil on how candidates raise and spend money, increasing transparency and accountability in local government.
<br>
<br>
We believe that when every New Yorker is empowered to participate meaningfully in elections, candidates will better reflect the communities they serve, elected leaders will be more accountable to the public, and New Yorkers will have a democracy they can truly trust.
<br>
<br>
ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT
<br>
<br>
The People and Engagement division is focused on ensuring that every member of the CFB can thrive, feel respected, and be fully engaged in our mission. The division encompasses two teams, the EEO/DEI unit and People Operations unit. The EEO/DEI team drives agency efforts to uphold fairness, build inclusive practices, and compliance with federal, state, and local laws prohibiting employment discrimination. The People Operations team works to deliver HR solutions in the areas of employee growth, talent management, succession planning, payroll management, compliance, labor relations, and policy implementation. Together we work to build people systems that allow for a positive employee experience and workplace culture.
