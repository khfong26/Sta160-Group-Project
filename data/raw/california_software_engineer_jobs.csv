<i>The general wage range for this position at Sierra Pacific Industries is from $69,000 and $115,000 per year, and is dependent upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to: relevant work experience, skill, knowledge, and/or education.</i><br>
<br>
<b>About Our Company
</b><br>
Sierra Pacific Industries is a fourth-generation family-owned company based in Northern California that started in 1949 and has grown to be one of the largest lumber and millwork producers in the U.S., employing around 6,500 crew members. Sierra Pacific continues to be a company where its employees are proud to work at state-of-the-art facilities and others strive to become part of the team.
<br>
<br>
We own and sustainably manage more than 2.4 million acres of timberland in California, Oregon, and Washington. Our forests are sustainably managed under a 100-year plan by Registered Professional Foresters, Wildlife Biologists, Botanists, and other professionals. We are growing forests for our future, planting over 6 million new trees every year. In Spring 2024, we planted our <b>300 millionth seedling</b> on our timberlands. This milestone was decades in the making, reflecting our commitment to sustainable forest management and ensuring we have forests not just for today, but for generations to come.<br>
<br>
Sierra Pacific effectively uses nearly 100% of every piece of wood we bring to our facilities. In fact, any small amount that isn't turned into hand-crafted doors and windows, millwork, lumber, or landscaping material is actually converted into electricity in our eight biomass-fueled power plants.

We are proud that all Sierra Pacific facilities follow our drug-free and tobacco-free policies. As part of our safety in the workplace policy, an offer of employment is subject to a negative drug screen result.

As a Staff Software Engineer, you will also provide technical leadership: mentoring junior engineers, driving best practices in code reviews and design discussions, and leading initiatives to modernize our software stack. You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to introduce modern engineering practices (e.g. continuous integration/continuous delivery for embedded, and advanced testing frameworks.) It is hybrid and requires some time in the lab each week. If you are passionate about building high-quality software that has a direct impact on human health, this role offers a unique blend of hands-on development and technical leadership. How You&rsquo;ll Make An Impact: Develop Embedded Control Software: Design and implement the core C++ control software that drives automated lab instruments, handling everything from device initialization to high-level coordination of subsystems to error handling. Orchestration &amp; Scheduling: Develop and maintain scheduling and orchestration logic to coordinate instrument operations (e.g. sample handling, reagent dispensing, measurements) at high throughput (100+ samples/hour). Ensure timed execution of workflows across multiple embedded controllers. Error Handling &amp; Recovery: Build robust error handling and fault recovery mechanisms. Anticipate error conditions (device faults, step loss, etc.) and implement recovery sequences that allow the instrument to safely continue or gracefully halt with minimal downtime. Firmware/Hardware Integration: Interface with distributed firmware microcontroller boards over a CANopen bus (coordinating 10+ boards). Maintain communication protocols and data models for commands/status and ensure reliable real-time messaging between the main software and firmware subsystems. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with systems engineering to align software with hardware design, with assay scientists to understand requirements, and with quality/regulatory teams to meet compliance and documentation standards. Coordinate integration activities and troubleshooting across mechanical, electronics, and assay domains. Technical Leadership &amp; Mentoring: Mentor junior and mid-level software engineers by sharing best practices in embedded development, performing design and code reviews, and guiding problem solving. Lead architectural discussions and contribute to design documentation for new features and systems. Lab work: Triaging and troubleshooting hardware/software integration issues, and providing expert technical guidance to cross-functional teams. Testing &amp; Automation: Drive improvements in software quality by expanding integration testing and simulation. Lead the development of hardware simulation frameworks and automated test suites to validate instrument behavior in CI/CD pipelines. Champion the use of continuous integration, unit testing, and other modern DevOps practices to increase software reliability and maintainability.</p><p></p>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>

The Advertiser Guidance team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns.

Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren&rsquo;t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don&rsquo;t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don&rsquo;t get paged for the same issue twice.<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth:<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>
