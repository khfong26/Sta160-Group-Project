<p></p><div><b>Role: Staff Software Engineer</b></div><div><b>
Location: Hercules, CA</b></div><div><b>
FTE</b></div><div></div><p><br>
As a Staff Software Engineer, you will also provide technical leadership: mentoring junior engineers, driving best practices in code reviews and design discussions, and leading initiatives to modernize our software stack. You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to introduce modern engineering practices (e.g. continuous integration/continuous delivery for embedded, and advanced testing frameworks.) It is hybrid and requires some time in the lab each week. If you are passionate about building high-quality software that has a direct impact on human health, this role offers a unique blend of hands-on development and technical leadership. How You&rsquo;ll Make An Impact: Develop Embedded Control Software: Design and implement the core C++ control software that drives automated lab instruments, handling everything from device initialization to high-level coordination of subsystems to error handling. Orchestration &amp; Scheduling: Develop and maintain scheduling and orchestration logic to coordinate instrument operations (e.g. sample handling, reagent dispensing, measurements) at high throughput (100+ samples/hour). Ensure timed execution of workflows across multiple embedded controllers. Error Handling &amp; Recovery: Build robust error handling and fault recovery mechanisms. Anticipate error conditions (device faults, step loss, etc.) and implement recovery sequences that allow the instrument to safely continue or gracefully halt with minimal downtime. Firmware/Hardware Integration: Interface with distributed firmware microcontroller boards over a CANopen bus (coordinating 10+ boards). Maintain communication protocols and data models for commands/status and ensure reliable real-time messaging between the main software and firmware subsystems. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with systems engineering to align software with hardware design, with assay scientists to understand requirements, and with quality/regulatory teams to meet compliance and documentation standards. Coordinate integration activities and troubleshooting across mechanical, electronics, and assay domains. Technical Leadership &amp; Mentoring: Mentor junior and mid-level software engineers by sharing best practices in embedded development, performing design and code reviews, and guiding problem solving. Lead architectural discussions and contribute to design documentation for new features and systems. Lab work: Triaging and troubleshooting hardware/software integration issues, and providing expert technical guidance to cross-functional teams. Testing &amp; Automation: Drive improvements in software quality by expanding integration testing and simulation. Lead the development of hardware simulation frameworks and automated test suites to validate instrument behavior in CI/CD pipelines. Champion the use of continuous integration, unit testing, and other modern DevOps practices to increase software reliability and maintainability.</p><p></p>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>
Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office</p></li><li><p>
Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we&rsquo;ll take care of the costs</p></li><li><p>
Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision.</p></li><li><p>
Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar.</p></li><li><p>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>
Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office</p></li><li><p>
Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we&rsquo;ll take care of the costs</p></li><li><p>
Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision.</p></li><li><p>
Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar.</p></li><li><p>
Parental Leave: Work with us to build a leave schedule that works for you and your family</p></li></ul><p></p><p>

Our brains are wired for vision. Half of our neural horsepower is dedicated to visual input. Evolution didn't train us to parse bullet points&mdash;it trained us to spot tigers in the bushes. That's why we process visuals 60,000 times faster than text and that&rsquo;s why we are building Monogram, a visual user interface for AI.</p><p>
Monogram is the first platform that lets LLMs control the entire user experience. By combining voice with UI generated on the fly, we create an experience that&rsquo;s far more powerful and engaging than a chatbot. We believe this paradigm will redefine how software is built.</p><p>
This user experience is consistent, as if a single designer crafted entire flows, hundreds of thousands of different interfaces, just for you, just for what you are trying to do at a moment in time, &quot;on the fly&quot;, in just 1 or 2 seconds.</p><p>
We're a deeply technical team of engineers and designers, tucked away in San Mateo, obsessively shaping the next interface for AI. Backed by top-tier investors behind category-defining companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Airbnb, Robinhood, Stripe, DoorDash, Shopify, and Slack.</p><p>

Monogram is the first visual interface for AI.</b><br>
<br>
Our brains are wired for vision. Half of our neural horsepower is dedicated to visual input. Evolution didn't train us to parse bullet points&mdash;it trained us to spot tigers in the bushes. That's why we process visuals 60,000 times faster than text and that&rsquo;s why we are building Monogram, a visual user interface for AI.</p><p>
Monogram is the first platform that lets LLMs control the entire user experience. By combining voice with UI generated on the fly, we create an experience that&rsquo;s far more powerful and engaging than a chatbot. We believe this paradigm will redefine how software is built.</p><p>
This user experience is consistent, as if a single designer crafted entire flows, hundreds of thousands of different interfaces, just for you, just for what you are trying to do at a moment in time, &quot;on the fly&quot;, in just 1 or 2 seconds.</p><p>
We're a deeply technical team of engineers and designers, tucked away in San Mateo, obsessively shaping the next interface for AI. Backed by top-tier investors behind category-defining companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Airbnb, Robinhood, Stripe, DoorDash, Shopify, and Slack.</p><p>
We're building a consumer app powered by this new technology stack. To do this, we're looking for the best iOS Engineers in the world.</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What You&rsquo;ll Work On

Build state of the art transitions and animations to bring the app to life</p></li><li><p>
Create a core navigation and architecture for our iOS app</p></li><li><p>

When people finance GPU clusters, the datacenters housing them, and the infrastructure powering them, they need &quot;offtake&quot; - meaning someone has signed a contract to lease the cluster for a period of time before its even built.</p><p>
Financing a GPU cluster is inherently risky, since margins are thin and volumes are huge. Lenders don't want to take on the risk that cluster developers can't repay their loan, and cluster developers really don't want to risk not selling their cluster. As a result, risk is offloaded to the customer using fixed-price long-term contracts.</p><p>
If you don't mitigate this customer risk, there's a bubble. This isn't SaaS anymore - application layer companies sign multi-year contracts for computer and inference, but sell to customers on monthly subscriptions. If you mess up a purchase, it's game over: a minor shift in your revenue growth rate might mean the difference between profit or bankruptcy. But what if companies could exit their contract by selling it back to the market?</p><p>
Otherwise, as AI scales, compute only becomes available to folks who can effectively take on that risk. A 2-person startup in a San Francisco Victorian can't realistically sign a 5-year take or pay contract on $100m supercomputers. But they may be able to buy the month of liquidity that someone else sold back.</p><p>
So that's what we make: a liquid market for GPU offtake.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Ship responsive, scalable solutions built to serve a large and diverse global audience.
<br><br>
Turn insights into impact by using analytics, user research, and community feedback to identify usability improvements and drive thoughtful feature development.
<br>What you need to succeed
<br><br>
5+ years of experience building and deploying web applications.
<br><br>
Strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design
<br><br>
<b>Experience with one or more of the following:</b> React, JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, RESTful API, Node.js
<br><br>
Strong verbal and written communication skills, especially when speaking to leaders and other collaborators.
<br><br>
A proactive approach—you take initiative, anticipate challenges, and don’t wait to be told what to do.
<br><br>
Experience in TypeScript/HTML/CSS and modern web technologies.
<br><br>
Ability to successfully implement and compete in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
<br><br>
Degree or equivalent experience in Computer Science.
<br>Nice to have
<br><br>
Experience in modern web-based editors or games (applications that emphasize detailed rendering, high UI performance, and real-time collaborative editing).
<br><br>
Experience in product localization (string overflow & truncation, etc).
<br><br>
Exposure to user analytics or feedback systems to inform UX improvements (usage of telemetry and feature flags to guide iteration or A/B tests).

Overview</p><p>
</p></div><div></div><div><div><div><b>Who is Flock?</b></div><p>
Flock Safety is the leading safety technology platform, helping communities thrive by taking a proactive approach to crime prevention and security. Our hardware and software suite connects cities, law enforcement, businesses, schools, and neighborhoods in a nationwide public-private safety network. Trusted by over 5,000 communities, 4,500 law enforcement agencies, and 1,000 businesses, Flock delivers real-time intelligence while prioritizing privacy and responsible innovation.</p><p>
We&rsquo;re a high-performance, low-ego team driven by urgency, collaboration, and bold thinking. Working at Flock means tackling big challenges, moving fast, and continuously improving. It&rsquo;s intense but deeply rewarding for those who want to make an impact.</p><p>

The Opportunity</b></p><p>
We're hiring a Senior Software Engineer to build Night Shift, a conversational AI assistant that helps investigators surface critical evidence and close cases faster. You'll design and implement the conversational interface, build the orchestration backend that manages LLM interactions and tool calling, and develop integration pipelines connecting our AI to Flock's existing data platform and APIs. This is a ground-floor opportunity where product thinking matters as much as technical execution: you'll shape chat experiences with complex context management, partner with platform teams to design new APIs or leverage existing ones, and solve the reliability challenges of deploying AI in high-stakes investigative workflows. You'll collaborate closely with ML engineers on prompt engineering and agentic workflows while maintaining a strong point of view on what makes a great user experience. If you've built LLM-powered products and thrive at the intersection of customer impact and technical depth, this role is for you.</p><p></p><p><b>

API integration skills: consume existing APIs or design new ones to ground AI in investigative data</div></li><li><div>
Database confidence: PostgreSQL and sophisticated SQL for data retrieval</div></li><li><div>
Cloud infrastructure basics: Docker, Kubernetes (Helm), AWS services (S3, SQS, API Gateway)</div></li><li><div>

Here&rsquo;s what they said.</b></div><p></p><p>
At most companies, engineers wait.</p><p>
Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.</p><p></p><p>
At Jerry.ai, we don&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>
If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: <b><i>&ldquo;At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you&rsquo;ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. <b><i>&ldquo;Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,&rdquo; </i></b>said another. <b><i>&ldquo;And things move fast.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We don&rsquo;t do bureaucracy. We don&rsquo;t do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. <b><i>&ldquo;The leaders here lead by example,&rdquo;</i></b> one teammate shared. <b><i>&ldquo;They have very high standards. They don&rsquo;t settle for just OK.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
It&rsquo;s challenging work, but it&rsquo;s meaningful. You&rsquo;ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You&rsquo;ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: <b><i>&ldquo;I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We&rsquo;re a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.</p><p></p><p><b>
So, what is </b><b>Jerry.ai</b><b> and why should you care?  </b></p><p>
Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you&rsquo;ll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage.

Here&rsquo;s what they said.</b></div><p></p><p>
At most companies, engineers wait.</p><p>
Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.</p><p></p><p>
At Jerry.ai, we don&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>
If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: <b><i>&ldquo;At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you&rsquo;ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. <b><i>&ldquo;Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,&rdquo; </i></b>said another. <b><i>&ldquo;And things move fast.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We don&rsquo;t do bureaucracy. We don&rsquo;t do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. <b><i>&ldquo;The leaders here lead by example,&rdquo;</i></b> one teammate shared. <b><i>&ldquo;They have very high standards. They don&rsquo;t settle for just OK.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
It&rsquo;s challenging work, but it&rsquo;s meaningful. You&rsquo;ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You&rsquo;ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: <b><i>&ldquo;I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We&rsquo;re a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.</p><p></p><p><b>
So, what is </b><b>Jerry.ai</b><b> and why should you care?  </b></p><p>
Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you&rsquo;ll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we&rsquo;re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we&rsquo;re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home.

Boldly built for every fandom, Tubi is a free streaming service that entertains over 100 million monthly active users. Tubi offers the world's largest collection of Hollywood movies and TV shows, thousands of creator-led stories and hundreds of Tubi Originals made for the most passionate fans. Headquartered in San Francisco and founded in 2014, Tubi is part of Tubi Media Group, a division of Fox Corporation.</p></div><p><b>
About the Role:</b></p>
<p>
The team is responsible for building and optimizing the UI/UX across all Web and OTT applications at Tubi. The team primarily focuses on implementing features related to user acquisition and growth, including but not limited to user registration, onboarding, SEO, and account management.</p>

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p>

We own and sustainably manage more than 2.4 million acres of timberland in California, Oregon, and Washington. Our forests are sustainably managed under a 100-year plan by Registered Professional Foresters, Wildlife Biologists, Botanists, and other professionals.

This milestone was decades in the making, reflecting our commitment to sustainable forest management and ensuring we have forests not just for today, but for generations to come.<br>
<br>
Sierra Pacific effectively uses nearly 100% of every piece of wood we bring to our facilities. In fact, any small amount that isn't turned into hand-crafted doors and windows, millwork, lumber, or landscaping material is actually converted into electricity in our eight biomass-fueled power plants.

This role is highly impactful: your contributions will form the backbone of the systems that deliver personalized, context-aware guidance to millions of advertisers. You will collaborate across science, product, and platform teams, and your work will focus on building resilient, observable, and maintainable systems that accelerate innovation in agent-based AI.<br>

About the team<br>
The Sponsored Products and Brands team at Amazon Ads is re-imagining the advertising landscape through the latest generative AI technologies, revolutionizing how millions of customers discover products and engage with brands across Amazon.com and beyond. We are at the forefront of re-inventing advertising experiences, bridging human creativity with artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the advertising lifecycle from ad creation and optimization to performance analysis and customer insights.<br>
We are a passionate group of innovators dedicated to developing responsible and intelligent AI technologies that balance the needs of advertisers, enhance the shopping experience, and strengthen the marketplace. If you're energized by solving complex challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI, join us in shaping the future of advertising.<br>
The Advertiser Guidance team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns. At this scale, the complexity of diverse advertiser goals, campaign types, and market dynamics creates both a massive technical challenge and a transformative opportunity: even small improvements in guidance systems can have outsized impact on advertiser success and Amazon&rsquo;s retail ecosystem.<br>
Our vision is to build a highly personalized, context-aware agentic advertiser guidance system that leverages LLMs together with tools such as auction simulations, ML models, and optimization algorithms. This agentic framework, will operate across both chat and non-chat experiences in the ad console, scaling to natural language queries as well as proactively delivering guidance based on deep understanding of the advertiser. To execute this vision, we collaborate closely with stakeholders across Ad Console, Sales, and Marketing to identify opportunities&mdash;from high-level product guidance down to granular keyword recommendations&mdash;and deliver them through a tailored, personalized experience. Our work is grounded in state-of-the-art agent architectures, tool integration, reasoning frameworks, and model customization approaches (including tuning, MCP, and preference optimization), ensuring our systems are both scalable and adaptive.</div><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Are you the type of engineer who thrives at the intersection of hardware and software? We're seeking passionate software engineers who love writing low-level C/C++ code for embedded systems, SOCs, and microcontrollers. Our ideal candidate is a software engineer at heart but possesses a deep understanding of the hardware architecture their code will run on - someone who understands that every bit of data moved and every cycle of the clock matters.<br>
<br>
Custom Amazon designed silicon chips live at the heart of AWS Machine Learning servers, enabling faster, more capable, and more accurate machine learning for our customers. We&rsquo;re looking for skilled software engineers to scale the team that develops the embedded software stack critical to the functionality of these bleeding-edge system-on-chips (SoCs). Your software will directly drive the execution and management of hardware accelerated neural network models deep within the SOC's Neuron Cores.
<br>
<br>
You'll also work closely with our architecture and design teams to drive hardware/software co-design, developing both firmware and custom hardware that enables ML within our accelerator chips. Our team's charter is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday software developers and to democratize access to industry leading infrastructure - you'll be enabling that vision from the ground up.
