We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years &mdash; scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company&rsquo;s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.).

We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.</p><p></p><p><b>
Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</div></li><li><div>
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</div></li><li><div>

<div>
The AI/Machine Learning Engineer is focused on supporting data scientists by building structures to house, expose, and execute models. Often this is in support of enhancing human decision pipelines, so that humans can focus on the more creative and difficult tasks and models can drive automation on the &quot;easy 80%&quot;. This is often a complex problem given the variability of systems at play in the credit union over the years. The data science team supports a mixture of batch and live models. The Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer is involved in the entire life cycle of the model from inception to monitoring, and if needed retirement. They work closely with Data Scientists to deploy models into various systems and Data Engineers to create the feature groups needed to support ongoing and future modeling needs, and do a lot of data engineering themselves. Their core focus and ownership within that pipeline is the tooling used to deliver models to production and server out to the greater enterprise in general. This includes building APIs and other types of interfaces. The end state should be that Data Scientists can self-serve as much as possible through the tooling and pipelines created by the Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer.</div><div></div><div><br>
Additionally, the Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer will be responsible for the standards and practices upon which AI/MLOps is performed at the credit union. This will be accomplished in partnership with the Lead Data Scientist.</div><div>
We do not model for the sake of modeling or to pad resumes. Everything is focused on working with a business owner to get the best (balancing complexity and accuracy) model into production and executing, even if that is a decision tree and not a neural network. We do not expect you to have all of the skills or exposure to all the tools listed below but be willing to work towards mastering them, and even help evolve their implementation (we do not know everything either). We put a heavy emphasis on being able to deploy models into production which includes writing tests, setting up monitoring, and performing code reviews.</div><div></div><div><br>
Our culture can be summed up as:</div><ul><li>
We all love building machine learning/AI systems</li><li>
We all have a life outside of work</li><li>
We challenge each other</li><li>
We prefer common tools and frameworks over niche tools and frameworks</li><li>
We prefer open source over proprietary, but do value the buy versus build judgement call when it is something we need but do not want as a core competency</li><li>
We value simplicity over complexity</li><li>
Always leave the code base better than you found it</li></ul><div>
What we value most in a team member is someone who can look at a vaguely defined problem and work iteratively in a collaborative fashion to find a clean solution.</div><div></div><div><br>
In general, the cadence of the team follows agile rituals, however, we do not expect models to be completed within a sprint. Being a data scientific focused team, we understand that we do not know the answers, and that modeling can take a lot of twists and turns. So, to aid in planning and communication we utilize agile rituals but understand that modeling deliverables can be wildly different both in size and time to complete.</div>
Responsibilities:
<ul><li><b>Lead.</b> Lead the architecture, design, and implementation of end-to-end ML/AI systems. This will involve direct supervision of ML/AI Engineers including 1:1s, performance evaluations, and direct involvement in onboarding and offboarding of.</li><li><b>
Communicate.</b> Collaborate with data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, and product managers to deliver impactful ML-driven features. The Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer works as an internal consultant, consulting with business functions across different financial functions. Communicating, and being able to learn the language of that business unit, is critical to success of any Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer. So financial experience is preferred, but not a must, as we have awesome product owners that are willing to help you along the way. Often the Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer will be communicating directly with senior management.</li><li><b>
Mentor. </b>Mentor and guide a team of ML/AI engineers and facilitate career development.</li><li><b>
Deploy Models</b>. Deploy models in production environments, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability. This will involve working with CI/CD pipelines, architecting the pipelines, and iterating on them to ensure efficient delivery.</li><li><b>
Monitor Models. </b>Monitor model performance and continuously improve accuracy, latency, and efficiency. Given the stakes of a model making decisions without human intervention, a heavy emphasis is put on monitoring the models. This ranges everywhere from data metrics such as accuracy and recall to run-time and call volume. The Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer will be required to set this up as a part of their model development within our monitoring tool.</li><li><b>
Educate. </b>Research and evaluate emerging ML/AI tools, frameworks, and methodologies. Then apply what is applicable and useful back into the ML/AIOps ecosystem at AFCU. Additionally, the Lead AI/Machine Learning Engineer will be educating citizen data scientists and business owners on data science best practices. A lot of which is tearing down the marketing fluff that ML/AI/Data Science...is magic and can solve all your problems and instead that it is just math and programming, and can be understood</li><li><b>
Document. </b>Define and enforce best practices in ML/AI engineering, including ML/AIOps, version control, testing, and model governance.</li><li><b>
Collaborate. </b>Partner with stakeholders to identify opportunities for applying ML/AI to enhance business outcomes.</li><li><b>
Innovate. </b>The data science team is structured in a centralized manner within the credit union, which gives us the ability to see across several business functions. Part of the team's role is to look at projects from the different business functions and implement cross functional synergies between different projects.</li></ul>
Qualifications:

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</div></li><li><div>
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</div></li><li><div>

Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p><b>

<p>
Roku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.</p>
<p>
We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p>

Great sellers are the lifeblood of every business. They build relationships, understand needs, and close deals that drive growth. But too often, they're buried under administrative work, disconnected tools, and processes that pull them away from what they do best&mdash;selling.</p><p>
We believe salespeople deserve better. They deserve technology that works for them, not against them.</p><p>
Revic is an AI-native sales acceleration engine built to uplift sales professionals. We handle the complexity&mdash;analyzing data, identifying opportunities, triggering the right workflows&mdash;so reps can focus on the human side of sales. The conversations. The relationships. The moments that matter.</p><p>
Our platform learns what's working, defines who to sell to, and gives reps the context they need to move with confidence and precision. It removes the friction that slows them down and amplifies their natural strengths.</p><p>
Sales will always be human. Revic exists to make sure it stays that way&mdash;by letting AI handle everything else.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Why This Role Exists</b></h1><p>
Revenue teams waste 70% of their time on meta-work instead of selling. We're fixing this with AI agents built on a collective memory - connecting messy real-world data into context that drives autonomous action.</p><p>
Now we need someone who gets excited about turning chaos into intelligent systems.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
The Technical Challenge</b></h1><p><b>
The Core Problem:</b> How do you build a true AI native system that&rsquo;s reliable enough to handle million-dollar enterprise deals?</p><p><b>
Your Mission:</b></p><ul><li><p>
Collect, collate and make useful data from 50+ data sources such as CRM, public data, communication streams</p></li><li><p>
Design data pipelines that can do this across TBs of data, reliably</p></li><li><p>
Design AI systems that can reason and act on messy data</p></li><li><p>
Build applications and data consumption mechanisms that elevate a seller&rsquo;s life and maximizes revenue instead of building the #45768 sales tech tool.</p></li><li><p>
Balance accuracy, latency, and cost across thousands of concurrent agent runs</p></li></ul><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Great sellers are the lifeblood of every business. They build relationships, understand needs, and close deals that drive growth. But too often, they're buried under administrative work, disconnected tools, and processes that pull them away from what they do best&mdash;selling.</p><p>
We believe salespeople deserve better. They deserve technology that works for them, not against them.</p><p>
Revic is an AI-native sales acceleration engine built to uplift sales professionals. We handle the complexity&mdash;analyzing data, identifying opportunities, triggering the right workflows&mdash;so reps can focus on the human side of sales. The conversations. The relationships. The moments that matter.</p><p>
Our platform learns what's working, defines who to sell to, and gives reps the context they need to move with confidence and precision. It removes the friction that slows them down and amplifies their natural strengths.</p><p>
Sales will always be human. Revic exists to make sure it stays that way&mdash;by letting AI handle everything else.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Why This Role Exists</b></h1><p>
Revenue teams waste 70% of their time on meta-work instead of selling. We're fixing this with AI agents built on a collective memory - connecting messy real-world data into context that drives autonomous action.</p><p>
Now we need someone who gets excited about turning chaos into intelligent systems.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
The Technical Challenge</b></h1><p><b>
The Core Problem:</b> How do you build a true AI native system that&rsquo;s reliable enough to handle million-dollar enterprise deals?</p><p><b>
Your Mission:</b></p><ul><li><p>
Collect, collate and make useful data from 50+ data sources such as CRM, public data, communication streams</p></li><li><p>
Design data pipelines that can do this across TBs of data, reliably</p></li><li><p>
Design AI systems that can reason and act on messy data</p></li><li><p>
Build applications and data consumption mechanisms that elevate a seller&rsquo;s life and maximizes revenue instead of building the #45768 sales tech tool.</p></li><li><p>
