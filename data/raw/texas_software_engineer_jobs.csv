Our hardware and software suite connects cities, law enforcement, businesses, schools, and neighborhoods in a nationwide public-private safety network. Trusted by over 5,000 communities, 4,500 law enforcement agencies, and 1,000 businesses, Flock delivers real-time intelligence while prioritizing privacy and responsible innovation.</p><p>
We&rsquo;re a high-performance, low-ego team driven by urgency, collaboration, and bold thinking. Working at Flock means tackling big challenges, moving fast, and continuously improving. It&rsquo;s intense but deeply rewarding for those who want to make an impact.</p><p>
With nearly $700M in venture funding and a $7.5B valuation, we&rsquo;re scaling intentionally and seeking top talent to help build the impossible. If you value teamwork, ownership, and solving tough problems, Flock could be the place for you.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
The Opportunity</b></h2><p>
We're hiring a Senior Software Engineer to build Night Shift, a conversational AI assistant that helps investigators surface critical evidence and close cases faster. You'll design and implement the conversational interface, build the orchestration backend that manages LLM interactions and tool calling, and develop integration pipelines connecting our AI to Flock's existing data platform and APIs. This is a ground-floor opportunity where product thinking matters as much as technical execution: you'll shape chat experiences with complex context management, partner with platform teams to design new APIs or leverage existing ones, and solve the reliability challenges of deploying AI in high-stakes investigative workflows. You'll collaborate closely with ML engineers on prompt engineering and agentic workflows while maintaining a strong point of view on what makes a great user experience. If you've built LLM-powered products and thrive at the intersection of customer impact and technical depth, this role is for you.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

</b><p>We build and operate the platform that makes change safe, predictable, and low-friction across the cloud. Engineers who join this team work on systems that coordinate deployments, enforce policy, and automate complex operational processes for thousands of internal users. The impact of our work is measured not in how fast we ship code, but in how much cognitive load and manual effort we remove for the engineers who rely on our platform.
</p><p>This is a team that values thoughtful engineering. Every feature must account for real-world failure modes, compliance constraints, and user experience. We design APIs and workflows so the safe path is the obvious path, and risky actions are either impossible or self-evident. We treat operational learning as input to product direction: when something becomes a repetitive pain point for support, compliance, or service teams, we encode the behavior into automation&mdash;not documentation or tribal knowledge.
</p><p>Engineers here are expected to think end-to-end: from design and implementation to rollout, telemetry, and iteration. We build observable systems with explicit behavior, predictable rollback paths, and clear semantics. We write documentation not because someone required it, but because shared understanding is how a high-performing platform team scales. The people who thrive here are curious, candid, and motivated by making complex systems feel simple for others.

Position Summary</b></p><p>
We are hiring a Full Stack Staff Software Engineer with strong React and Python experience to join our Data Engineering team. You will take a lead role in the end-to-end development of a new, critical internal self-service application. Your work on this software solution will be instrumental in our initiative to modernize how data is accessed and managed, enabling teams across the company to easily work with their own data through the user-friendly tools you build. This project involves a shift from traditional data handling processes, with your primary focus being creating a robust application that empowers this new approach to data accessibility and decentralized ownership.</p><p></p><p><b>
About this Role:</b></p><p>
This is a high-impact, high-autonomous role is suited for a detail-oriented and collaborative individual who thrives on ownership, knows how to apply best practices, and can independently design, build, and maintain production-grade software.

AWS Sales, Marketing, and Global Services (SMGS) is responsible for driving revenue, adoption, and growth from the largest and fastest growing small- and mid-market accounts to enterprise-level customers including public sector. The AWS Global Support team interacts with leading companies and believes that world-class support is critical to customer success. AWS Support also partners with a global list of customers that are building mission-critical applications on top of AWS services.<br>
<br>
Come join the AWS Marketplace Team in our mission to change the way enterprise software are bought and sold! AWS Marketplace enables software sellers to reach all AWS customers; and enables software buyers to easily discover, purchase and consume software. Our goals include enriching the platform to support more diverse selection, improving buyer and seller experience and implementing new ideas to add new dimensions to the product. Our vision is to make AWS Marketplace one stop shop for buying and selling software just like Amazon.com is for retail.<br>
<br>
We are looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to help the team take AWS Marketplace to the next level. As a Software Development Engineer on the team you will own significant portions of the product and will have significant influence on our strategy by helping define the next wave of product features and system architecture. The systems are complex and there are huge opportunities to work at all levels from the front end user experience, to a set of robust platform services, to system level pieces and everything in between. You should be somebody who enjoys working on complex system software, is customer-centric, and is passionate about building quality software as well as achieving operational excellence.
<br>
<br>
The ideal candidate will have a demonstrable track record of success delivering new features or products. This person has thrived and succeeded in delivering high quality technology products/services in a hyper-growth environment where priorities shift fast. They have design and implementation experience, knowledge of web services and protocols, and an in-depth knowledge of distributed systems architectures.

Amazon&rsquo;s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.<br>
<br>
Work/Life Balance:<br>
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren&rsquo;t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don&rsquo;t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don&rsquo;t get paged for the same issue twice.<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth:<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>
