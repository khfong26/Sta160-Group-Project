You&rsquo;ll directly impact installation speed, safety, and uptime while your insights will shape our hardware roadmap and operating procedures.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What You'll Bring</b></p><ul><li><p>
2+ years in a technical support, electrical, or IT troubleshooting role.</p></li><li><p>

So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for &ldquo;GRIT&rdquo;. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here&rsquo;s what that means for you: we&rsquo;re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve <b>G</b>oals, achieve <b>R</b>esults within their job responsibilities, contribute <b>I</b>nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader <b>T</b>eam through collaboration and attitude.</p><p></p><p><b>
About the team and role</b></p><p>
We are building a new Discovery product organization at Scribd.com, and this role is the founding Director of Product for that group. You will lead the strategy and execution across our recommendations, search, ranking, and discovery experiences.</p><p>
Our corpus spans hundreds of millions of documents, and our goal is not just to help people find files, but to help hundreds of millions of applied learners discover the knowledge inside those documents. You will define how we evolve from traditional search and recs into a real-time, LLM-augmented discovery system that understands user intent, reasons across our corpus, and returns trustworthy, explainable results.</p><p>
This is both a strategic and operational leadership role. You will manage and mentor PM leaders, partner with Engineering, Machine Learning, Applied Research, Design, Content, and Data Science, and establish the discovery roadmap that will shape Scribd.com&rsquo;s long-term engagement, retention, and subscription growth.</p><p></p><p><b>
About you</b></p><p>
You are a product leader who lives at the intersection of user problems, ML systems, and business outcomes. You have built or led teams that own discovery, personalization, or search at meaningful scale, and you are comfortable shaping long-term vision while shipping iterative value along the way. You can talk embeddings and LLM architectures with engineers, and you can just as easily frame a strategy for executives in terms of learner outcomes and subscription value.

When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It&rsquo;s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees &ndash; in partnership with their manager &ndash; can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs.

In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here&rsquo;s what that means for you: we&rsquo;re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve <b>G</b>oals, achieve <b>R</b>esults within their job responsibilities, contribute <b>I</b>nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader <b>T</b>eam through collaboration and attitude.</p><p></p><p>

About Us</b></p><p></p><p>
Senseye is a NeuroTechnology Company in Austin, TX on the cusp of revolutionizing Mental Health.

Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p><b>

About Us</b></p><p>
Senseye is a NeuroTechnology Company in Austin, TX on the cusp of revolutionizing Mental Health. Over the past 6 years we have invested millions of dollars in R&amp;D to build our platform allowing us to measure cognitive activity via the eye through mobile phones. Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p></p><p><b>

Examples of our projects:</p>
We built an agentic AI solution that redefined event information access for a global technology leader, delivering instant, accurate answers to attendee questions at scale. Using Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and Azure Machine Learning, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we engineered a secure, multilingual Copilot platform capable of processing data from 22 file formats across multiple sources. Our team leveraged Azure Databricks for advanced data transformation, Azure Front Door for global load balancing, and Microsoft Entra ID with Azure Key Vault for enterprise-grade security. The result: a system that served over 200,000 users, handled millions of interactions, and reduced support requests by 70%, setting a new benchmark for scalable, intelligent, and personalized event experiences.<br>
<ul><li>
</li>
We built a high-performance reporting solution that redefined data refresh efficiency for a leading office supply retailer, delivering near real-time insights and dramatically faster report access. By integrating Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables into Microsoft Fabric via OneLake shortcuts and leveraging Power BI&rsquo;s Direct Lake mode, we built a scalable architecture that eliminated data duplication and significantly reduced latency. Our team leveraged Azure Data Lake Storage for external volume dumps, semantic modeling for streamlined analytics, and Fabric F256 SKU with autoscale for optimized compute. The result: report load times dropped by 80%, refresh cycles shrank from 10 days to minutes, and infrastructure costs fell by 60%, setting a new benchmark for enterprise-grade reporting performance.<br>
<li>
</li>
We helped a global industrial technology leader transform its construction operations by replacing a fragmented, batch-based ERP system with a real-time intelligence solution built on Microsoft Fabric. The previous setup&mdash;based on Databricks and Snowflake&mdash;struggled with delayed data updates, high maintenance, and siloed systems. By implementing Microsoft Fabric&rsquo;s Real-Time Intelligence capabilities, including Eventstreams, Reflex, and Power BI dashboards, we enabled real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, and instant insights. The result: 20&ndash;30% cost savings, 50% less IT maintenance, and a 10x improvement in data latency. This empowered faster decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and a more agile, data-driven organization.<br>
<li>
</li>
We helped a Fortune 500 office supply retailer modernize its reporting by migrating from MicroStrategy to Power BI. The legacy system was costly and inefficient, requiring over 150 duplicate reports and individual licenses for each user. Our solution consolidated these into just five dynamic Power BI reports, each customizable with bookmarks and filters. By leveraging Snowflake and Import Mode, we delivered a scalable semantic model and a user-friendly experience. The result: reduced license costs, faster reporting, and empowered business users with self-service analytics.<br>
<li>
</li><li>
We built an AI-powered chatbot for a global manufacturer of industrial test and diagnostic equipment to improve access to project lifecycle management data. Using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure App Service, the solution indexed documents from SharePoint&mdash;including PDFs, Excel files, and dynamic web pages&mdash;into a centralized, searchable interface. Power Automate and custom code streamlined data ingestion and processing, while Azure Cosmos DB stored historical interactions. The chatbot enabled employees to retrieve accurate insights quickly, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making. Post-deployment, the client achieved higher productivity, lower operational costs, and seamless access to project data through a single unified interface.</li></ul><p>

Parq delivers the world's fastest, highest-quality Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), transforming the complex environmental reporting ecosystem. Through cutting-edge AI and large language models, we empower manufacturers to reduce their environmental impact and create a sustainable future.</p><p>
Our founder created Parq after experiencing the EPD process firsthand. Frustrated by its lengthy duration, exorbitant consulting fees, and complex stakeholder requirements, he witnessed how manufacturing companies&mdash;the very builders of our world&mdash;were being underserved. This inspired him to revolutionize the process.</p><p>
The opportunity is massive: in 2025, over $400 billion in construction projects required environmental product declarations. .</p><p>
We blend in-person collaboration at our Austin, TX office with flexible 3&ndash;5 day work weeks, nurturing a culture where freedom, gratitude, and integrity drive meaningful impact.</p><p><b>
Your Role</b></p><p>
Build a new platform from the ground up: Parq is seeking a Senior Full Stack Engineer with a strong front-end focus to spearhead development of our web dashboard and data tools. You&rsquo;ll own the user interface and experience for a our new SaaS platform &ndash; zero-to-one development with no legacy code. If you thrive in fast-moving startups and love working with Next.js/React to create beautiful, data-rich applications, this is your opportunity to have outsized impact on both a product and mission.</p><p>
Why this role is special: You&rsquo;ll be building from scratch in a greenfield environment, transforming complex, unstructured datasets into intuitive visualizations and insights. As the frontend lead, you will architect and build interactive dashboards and analytics tools that help users understand their data at a glance. You&rsquo;ll also collaborate closely with our backend team (working with Python, FastAPI, LLMs, and retrieval-augmented generation systems) &ndash; together bringing cutting-edge AI features to life in the UI. This means you&rsquo;ll be on the forefront of integrating modern AI (LLM workflows, embedding-based search) into a seamless product experience for our customers.</p><p><b>
What You&rsquo;ll Do</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Lead Frontend Development:</b> Design and implement the entire front-end architecture using Next.js and React. You will set coding standards, choose frameworks/libs, and build out the structure of a high-performance single-page application.</li>
<li><b>Own User Experience:</b> Take ownership of UI/UX decisions for dashboards and SaaS platform components. You&rsquo;ll have freedom (and responsibility) to make the product easy to use and visually appealing, from layout and navigation to performance optimizations and accessibility.</li>
<li><b>Build Data-Rich Features:</b> Create intuitive dashboards, interactive visualizations, and data tools that turn unstructured data into actionable insights for users. You&rsquo;ll be plotting complex data in clear, compelling ways &ndash; think charts, graphs, and real-time updates for analytics.</li>
<li><b>Innovate with AI &amp; Search</b>: Develop frontend components that integrate with our AI-powered backend &ndash; e.g. embedding-based search interfaces, smart autocomplete and filtering, and displaying results from LLM analysis. You&rsquo;ll help surface outputs of our retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines in a user-friendly manner.</li>
<li><b>Collaborate Across the Stack:</b> Work closely with backend engineers to consume FastAPI endpoints and ensure smooth end-to-end functionality. You&rsquo;ll influence API design and adjust frontend implementations to accommodate large language model outputs and other backend services.</li>
<li><b>Startup Leadership:</b> Operate in a small, fast-paced startup team where you can wear multiple hats. You might prototype a quick feature for a demo one week and refine the design of a core component the next. Your ideas will directly shape the product, and you&rsquo;ll help establish best practices for the growing engineering team.</li>
</ul><p></p><p><b>
Requirements</b></p><p><b>
What We&rsquo;re Looking For</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Senior Frontend Expertise:</b> 5+ years of experience building modern web applications, with deep proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and ideally Next.js (or similar SSR frameworks). You&rsquo;ve built and shipped complex front-end features or products from scratch before.</li>
<li><b>UI/UX &amp; Data Visualization Skills:</b> Proven ability to craft intuitive user interfaces for data-heavy applications. Experience with charts/graphs libraries (d3.js, Chart.js, etc.) or building custom visualizations is a big plus. You can turn large datasets or analytical results into a clean, engaging visual experience.</li>
<li><b>Full-Stack Knowledge:</b> Comfort working with backend technologies and APIs. You can consume and debug RESTful APIs (experience with Python/FastAPI or similar is a bonus) and you understand how front-end and back-end align for a robust product. While your focus is frontend, you&rsquo;re capable of diving into the backend when needed to unblock or tweak an API.</li>
<li><b>AI/Data Enthusiasm:</b> Exposure to unstructured data or ML/AI-driven products is a nice-to-have. Maybe you&rsquo;ve integrated a third-party NLP service, worked with search or recommendation APIs, or are just eager to learn about vector embeddings and LLMs. You don&rsquo;t need to be an AI expert, but you&rsquo;re excited to work on a product that involves machine learning and intelligent data processing.</li>
<li><b>Ownership &amp; Drive:</b> You take initiative and can lead projects end-to-end with minimal guidance. As a senior engineer, you make architectural decisions, write high-quality maintainable code, and mentor others through code reviews and knowledge sharing. You thrive in environments with autonomy, and you enjoy the responsibility of making critical technical decisions.</li>
<li><b>Adaptability:</b> Ability to work in a fast-paced startup context &ndash; you&rsquo;re agile, handle ambiguity well, and can balance quick iterations with engineering rigor. Experience at a startup or in a small, cross-functional team is valued.</li>
<li><b>Bonus Points:</b> Hands-on experience with DevOps, CI/CD, or cloud infrastructure. If you&rsquo;ve set up front-end build pipelines, automated deployments, or have familiarity with AWS/Azure and Docker, that&rsquo;s a plus (optional, not required). This additional skill set could allow you to contribute to our deployment process and overall developer experience.</li>
</ul><p><b>
What&rsquo;s In It for You</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Impact &amp; Ownership:</b> Your work will directly shape a mission-driven product in its early days. As one of the first senior engineers focusing on frontend, you&rsquo;ll have a high degree of ownership and a visible impact on product direction. This role offers the chance to grow into a frontend lead/architect as the company scales.</li>
<li><b>Cutting-Edge Challenges:</b> Work on truly innovative problems at the intersection of climate tech and AI. You&rsquo;ll be tackling challenges in data visualization, user experience design for AI outputs, and integration of modern AI (LLMs) into a real product. It&rsquo;s a playground for honing skills in a hot area of tech.</li>
<li><b>Talented, Passionate Team:</b> Join a small team of engineers, data scientists, and sustainability experts who are passionate about our mission. We maintain a collaborative, low-ego culture where everyone&rsquo;s ideas are valued. You&rsquo;ll work closely with the Head of Engineering and founders, giving you exposure to all aspects of building a startup.</li>
<li><b>Fast Growth Environment:</b> As a startup (with funding to execute on our vision), we are growing quickly. You&rsquo;ll experience the startup journey first-hand, with opportunities to take on new responsibilities, learn new skills, and advance your career rapidly as the company expands.</li>

Core Values</b></p><p>
Our founder aspires to fish with his great-grandchildren in rivers where his grandfather taught him. To achieve this, we need solutions to help businesses identify and reduce their environmental impact for future generations.</p><p>
Though our team is small, we aim high. We've established core principles that we believe will build a great company.</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Live Free:</b> We practice living free&mdash;free to take action, free to push bounds, and free to bet big.</li>
<li><b>Embrace Gratitude:</b> We seek to appreciate the positive aspects of life, both big and small, and to focus on a positive mindset.</li>
<li><b>Take Empathetic Action:</b> We seek first to understand and then to be understood.</li>
<li><b>Embody Perseverance:</b> What we do is not always easy, but easy things are rarely worth doing. When things get tough, we pull together to accomplish good things.</li>

Annapurna Labs designs silicon and software that accelerates innovation. Customers choose us to create cloud solutions that solve challenges that were unimaginable a short time ago&mdash;even yesterday. Our custom chips, accelerators, and software stacks enable us to take on technical challenges that have never been seen before, and deliver results that help our customers change the world.<br>
<br>
In Annapurna Labs we are at the forefront of hardware/software co-design not just in Amazon Web Services (AWS) but across the industry. Our Chassis Software team is looking for candidates interested in diving deep into the different hardware technologies that power our Machine Learning servers and develop the software and firmware to drive, support and sustain these technologies as they evolve though concept and manufacturing, and finally take their place in our rapidly expanding fleet of cutting edge Machine Learning products our customers demand.<br>
<br>
Key job responsibilities<br>
<ul><li>Provide Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) and Satellite Management Controller (SMC) software and firmware for Machine Learning Accelerator (MLA) servers.</li><li>Continuously collaborate with other server and board software teams responsible for accelerator management firmware and other programmable logic devices.</li><li>Work within the larger MLA Systems Software group to support development of mission-mode firmware, exercisers for manufacturing and vetting, and automation for qualification and deployment.</li><li>Engage in new product development by participating in early concept design reviews, schematic approvals, offsite board bringup and laboratory-based testing.</li></ul><br>
A day in the life<br>
The MLA Chassis Software team was formed to focus on board firmware primarily for mission-mode control of sensors and other board-level hardware. This includes debug, testing, qualification, and manufacturing. We touch technologies from device drivers to the I2C infrastructure pervasive in the server and everything in between. We are not working on machine learning algorithms, but rather we work on the physical systems (hardware) which execute and accelerate those machine learning algorithms. Data paths, I2C, and device control are our bread and butter. Some of us know what a Tensor is but really it's not what we do.<br>
<br>
About the team<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge-sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.

Inclusive Team Culture<br>
Here at AWS, it&rsquo;s in our nature to learn and be curious. Our employee-led affinity groups foster a culture of inclusion that empower us to be proud of our differences. Ongoing events and learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences, inspire us to never stop embracing our uniqueness.<br>
<br>
Work/Life Balance<br>
We value work-life harmony. Achieving success at work should never come at the expense of sacrifices at home, which is why we strive for flexibility as part of our working culture. When we feel supported in the workplace and at home, there&rsquo;s nothing we can&rsquo;t achieve in the cloud.
<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth<br>
