About Us:</b></div>
<div>
For over 35 years, TERREPOWER (formerly BBB Industries) has been a leader in sustainable manufacturing, driving the circular economy by extending the life of essential products in the automotive and industrial markets.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
Founded in 1987 in Daphne, Alabama by the Bigler family, TERREPOWER began as a small regional remanufacturer of starters and alternators. Our commitment to quality and innovation quickly earned us a reputation as a trusted name in the automotive industry.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
Recognizing new challenges and opportunities, in 2019 we set our sights on EV battery upcycling-addressing one of the industry&rsquo;s most pressing issues. Our engineering team pioneered solutions to extend EV battery life, pushing the boundaries of sustainable innovation.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
Recognizing that demand for solar panels would exceed availability and 100,000 tons of waste would potentially go into landfills by 2035, our team searched for an innovative way to upcycle solar panels. With an eye on the future, we developed ways to upcycle solar panels.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
Rooted in family and community values, we&rsquo;re proud to have second-generation employees contributing to our legacy. Backed by Clearlake Capital, we&rsquo;ve expanded our footprint into Europe with facilities in Spain, Italy, Denmark, Germany and Poland. We now sustainably manufacture and supply an assortment of nondiscretionary repair parts across more than 90 countries.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div>
As we move forward under the TERREPOWER name, we remain committed to the same values that have always defined us: entrepreneurship, teamwork, customer-centered, sustainability, safety.</div><br>
<div></div>
<div><b>
Why Join Us?</b></div>
