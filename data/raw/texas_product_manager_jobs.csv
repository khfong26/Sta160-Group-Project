Inter-Roadmap Conflict Resolution: </b>Proactively identify and resolve conflicts or resource contention arising from competing demands across different Product Managers' feature roadmaps.</li><li><b>

Priority Management: </b>Support the Technical Lead(s) in ensuring the team stays focused by managing and communicating changes in work priority, often resulting from negotiations with the multiple PMs.</li><li><b>
Agile Conductor: </b>Lead the technical aspects of all Agile events (especially refinement and planning) to ensure the team is focused, technically aligned, and protected from priority shifts.</li></ul><p></p><b><br>
Qualifications</b><p></p><p><b><br>

Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and payouts. We also help merchants connect with their customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk.

<p>Olly Olly is a $25M ARR digital marketing company with 350 employees helping small, local businesses grow without becoming marketers. We're transitioning from a website-plus-marketing-tools platform into an intelligent growth operating system&mdash;built on the philosophy that marketing should be automatic, not accidental.</p>
<p>Our customers are busy contractors and professional service providers drowning in 5-7 fragmented marketing vendors. They don't want to learn local SEO or manage review workflows&mdash;they want to focus on their craft while their online presence &quot;just works.&quot; We solve the fragmentation trap with software that systematizes our services team's expertise and automation that removes marketing decisions from business owners' plates entirely.</p>
<p><b>Role Overview</b></p><br>
<p>We're hiring a Head of Product to architect the future state of Olly Olly while maintaining current customer value. This is a transformation year&mdash;not iterating a mature product, but building our 2026 vision of an automation-first growth OS.</p>
<p>You'll own end-to-end product strategy and execution, leading a team of 1 (Product Manager) with 80% strategic / 20% tactical focus. You'll co-create product vision with the CEO, run outcome-driven cross-functional partnerships with Design, Engineering, Revenue, and Marketing, and build a high-impact product that drives activation, retention, NPS, and revenue lift.</p>
<p><b>The Challenge:</b></p>
<p><b>Today: </b>Make local SEO and online visibility automatic for people who hate marketing.</p>
<p><b>Tomorrow: </b>Design systems sophisticated enough to demo Olly Auto's power, yet obvious enough that a plumber can onboard self-serve. Make running a local service business automatic for people who want to focus on their craft, not operations&mdash;from first customer touchpoint through final invoice and review follow-up.</p>
<p><b>Your role: </b>Architect the bridge from where we are to where we're going, while maintaining current customer value throughout the transformation.</p>

&quot;Below the waterline&quot; systems: citation building, directory management, GBP Guardian/protection, review workflows&mdash;the 90% invisible work that makes marketing &quot;just work&quot;</li><li>
New product bets: AI-generated business audit reports (lead gen), invoice/estimate tools, waitlists, free trial infrastructure, competitive moats against Angi and traditional agencies</li></ul>
<p><b>Services-to-software transformation:</b></p>

<p><b>Strategy to outcomes:</b></p>
<ul><li>Set clear goals tied to activation, retention, NPS, and revenue; run an outcome-driven product operating rhythm</li><li>
Prove key product bets: Can we automate GBP management to the point customers never think about it? Will AI audit reports drive qualified pipeline? Can scheduling/invoicing deepen engagement and prevent churn?</li><li>
How do we design automation that makes small business owners 10x more productive&mdash;handling more customers with fewer people and less time spent on operations?</li></ul>
<p><b>Customer research &amp; insights:</b></p>

Co-own website and content workflows with Product Marketing/Design; coordinate with Marketing on external comms to ensure message-product fit</li></ul>

Job Description</b></h2><p>
We are seeking a highly analytical and strategic Product Manager that is responsible for building data insights platforms to answer the most critical questions for our business : How is our investment in AI impacting productivity? How healthy are our technical operations? And how is it all driving business results?</p><p></p><p>
This role is responsible for creating measurements, intelligence platforms and insights across three core domains: enterprise AI productivity, technical product operations (system performance, cloud costs, security), and business outcomes (sales, customer satisfaction, finance).</p><p></p><p>
You will be the go-to expert for defining the right metrics, building insightful dashboards, and telling compelling stories with data that drive action at every level of the company. If you are passionate about transforming raw data into a strategic asset, this role is for you.</p><p></p><p>
Key Responsibilities</p><ul><li><p>
Vision &amp; Strategy: Define, own, and communicate the product vision, strategy, and roadmap for a data driven approach to driving outcomes in Enterprise Productivity, Product Operations &amp; Business Intelligence</p></li><li><p>
Measurements and Insights:</p><ul><li><p>
Figuring out if our big bets on AI are paying off. You'll be the one to measure how new AI tools&mdash;like code assistants&mdash;are impacting our developers' speed and quality of work. Your findings will help us decide where to invest next.</p></li><li><p>
Bringing our tech data together. Our teams are incredible, but their data is all over the place. You&rsquo;ll be the one to finally bring it all together. Think of one central place to see our system availability (SRE), cloud spend (FinOps), and security status, without needing to open ten different tabs with clear insights in each of these areas.</p></li><li><p>
Connecting code to cash. This is the big one. You'll sit down with our leaders in Sales, Customer Support, and Finance to build the dashboards they <i>actually</i> want to use&mdash;the ones that clearly show how our performance is impacting the sales pipeline and customer happiness.</p></li><li><p>
Being our data champion. You won't just build things; you'll get people to use them. Your goal is to make data a natural part of every important conversation we have as a company.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>
Execution &amp; Delivery:</p><ul><li><p>
Partner closely with data scientists, ML engineers, and development teams to design and refine dashboards.</p></li><li><p>
Work with the development team to establish clear timelines, manage the product backlog, and ensure the successful delivery of projects.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>
Adoption &amp; Stakeholder Management:</p><ul><li><p>
Be the face of the team with executives, regularly communicating the insights, product roadmap, progress against goals, and the value proposition of your products.</p></li><li><p>
Establish a regular cadence with teams to gather feedback, address concerns, and drive necessary actions for continuous improvement.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p></p><p>
What Success Looks Like (Key Objectives for the First 6-12 Months)</p><ul><li><p>
Drive the Next Phase of the Productivity and Operational metrics: Take ownership of the existing platform, define and deliver on the 2026 roadmap, expanding its scope and impact</p></li><li><p>
Deliver Actionable BI Dashboards: Launch the foundational modules of the executive BI suite (e.g., Sales and Deployment dashboards), providing critical data to inform strategic decisions and creating the framework for future expansion.</p></li><li><p>
Establish Communication Cadence: Implement a structured process for communicating the insights and gathering feedback from all key stakeholders and end-user groups.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>
Skills &amp; Qualifications</p><ul><li><p>
A knack for storytelling with data&mdash;you can take a complex dataset and make it understandable and actionable for our executives.</p></li><li><p>
The ability to speak both 'tech' and 'business' fluently, connecting with engineers and sales leaders alike.</p></li><li><p>
Proven experience in product management, with a strong preference for candidates who have built and launched analytical products, dashboards, or data platforms.</p></li><li><p>
Hands-on skills with data tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, or similar platforms because you aren't afraid to dig for answers yourself.</p></li><li><p>
Real-world experience or familiarity with modern tech operations (SRE, FinOps, or security metrics).</p></li></ul><p></p><p>
Good to Have Skills</p><ul><li><p>
