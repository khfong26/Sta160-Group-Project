<br><br>
The Intelligence and Investigations team seeks to rapidly identify and mitigate abuse and strategic risks to ensure a safe online ecosystem. We are dedicated to identifying emerging abuse trends, analyzing risks, and working with our internal and external partners to implement effective mitigation strategies to protect against misuse. Our efforts contribute to OpenAI's overarching goal of developing AI that benefits humanity.
<br><br>
The Strategic Intelligence & Analysis (SIA) team provides safety intelligence for OpenAI’s products by monitoring, analyzing, and forecasting real-world abuse, geopolitical risks, and strategic threats. Our work informs safety mitigations, product decisions, and partnerships, ensuring OpenAI’s tools are deployed securely and responsibly across critical sectors.
<br><br>
About the role
<br><br>
We are looking for a data visualization analyst who can turn complex intelligence and forecast outputs into clear, interactive visual stories that shape how OpenAI manages risk. In this role, you build the dashboards, maps, and visual frameworks that leadership and partners rely on to understand where risks are emerging, how they evolve over time, and which mitigations matter most.
<br><br>
You will combine data visualization, forecasting literacy, and strong visual design skills to create “front doors” into our risk landscape: interactive views of safety and abuse patterns, geopolitical developments, and market shifts across regions and supply chains. You will work closely with analysts, forecasters, investigators, data scientists, and policy partners to turn noisy, multi-source inputs into visual products that directly influence priorities and resourcing.
<br><br>
In this role, you will
<br><br>
Design and build dashboards and interactive visualizations that track:
<br><br>
Emerging safety and abuse risks across products and geographies.
<br><br>
Geopolitical developments that affect OpenAI’s risk posture.
<br><br>
Key abuse cases and incident trends using both structured and unstructured data.
<br><br>
<b>Develop interactive risk views such as:</b><br>
Prioritization heat maps for safety and abuse scenarios.
<br><br>
“Emerging risks” boards with drill-downs for deep dives.
<br><br>
Forecast views of risk trajectories, including scenario comparisons over time.
<br><br>
<b>Partner with analysts and investigators to:</b><br>
Translate narrative intelligence, case studies, and OSINT into visual formats.
<br><br>
Standardize how we visualize incidents, metrics, campaigns, and risk clusters.
<br><br>
Iterate quickly on visual prototypes in response to ongoing investigations or emerging crises.
<br><br>
Collaborate with data science, Safety Systems, Integrity, Global Affairs, and Product teams to:
<br><br>
Ingest and align data from multiple internal systems and external sources.
<br><br>
Ensure visualizations are accurate, timely, and consistent with existing metrics and taxonomies.
<br><br>
Build views that are directly usable in leadership reviews, safety councils, and partner briefings.
<br><br>
<b>Establish and maintain a visual “source of truth” for:</b><br>
Top strategic risk themes and their evolution over time.
<br><br>
Cross-geography views (e.g., markets, supply chains, infrastructure) for safety and geopolitical risk.
<br><br>
Key mitigations and owners linked to specific risk categories or regions.
<br><br>
Create templates, style guides, and reusable components so that the team can rapidly produce consistent, high-quality visual materials (dashboards, one-pagers, workshop materials, and exec reviews).
<br><br>
You might thrive in this role if you
<br><br>
Significant experience (typically 4+ years) in data visualization, business intelligence, or analytics, ideally in security, trust and safety, intelligence, risk, or policy environments.
<br><br>
Demonstrated expertise with at least one major data visualization / BI stack (e.g., Tableau, Looker, Power BI, Mode, Superset, or equivalent), including building interactive dashboards for non-technical stakeholders.
<br><br>
Strong baseline analytics skills, including experience taking data from APIs, building ETL pipelines, and wrangling structured and unstructured data into real-time or near-real-time dashboards; familiarity with real-time or streaming data frameworks is a plus.
<br><br>
Familiarity with React or D3.js (or similar JavaScript-based visualization libraries), with the ability to build or customize visual components directly in code, is a strong plus for this role.
<br><br>
Experience visualizing time-series, event-based, and scenario/forecast data, including:
<br><br>
Trendlines, trajectories, and leading indicators.
<br><br>
Clear communication of uncertainty and confidence levels.
<br><br>
Strong skills in structuring and visualizing complex problem spaces, such as:
<br><br>
Multi-dimensional risk taxonomies and prioritization frameworks (likelihood, impact, exposure).
<br><br>
Geospatial and network views of entities, campaigns, or supply chains.
<br><br>
<b>Solid visual and graphic design capabilities, including:</b><br>
An eye for clear information design, layout, and visual hierarchy.
<br><br>
Ability to apply consistent visual standards across dashboards and static materials.
<br><br>
Experience with design tools such as Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or similar, or a portfolio demonstrating equivalent skills.
<br><br>
Ability to work with data from diverse sources and levels of maturity (structured metrics, case notes, OSINT, qualitative assessments) and to design visuals that faithfully reflect both the data and its limits.
<br><br>
Proficiency in SQL and working knowledge of Python for querying large datasets, exploratory analysis, and building data pipelines that feed dashboards and reporting.
<br><br>
Proven experience collaborating with cross-functional partners (e.g., analysts, data scientists, policy teams, operations) to define requirements and iterate quickly on visual products.
<br><br>
Strong written and verbal communication skills, including the ability to walk stakeholders through visualizations, design choices, and forecast representations in a clear and concise way.

 <p>The City of Sacramento, Sacramento County, California, was founded in 1849, and is the oldest incorporated city in California. In 1920, Sacramento City voters adopted a City Charter (municipal constitution) and a City Council-City Manager form of government, which are still used today.</p>
<p>The City Council consists of a Mayor elected by all City voters, and Councilmembers elected to represent the eight separate Council districts in the City. Each district is a separate geographical area with a population of about 51,000 residents. Each Councilmember must be a registered voter and live in the district they represent. Elected members serve 4 year terms and elections are staggered every two years in even numbered years. (Council District Information, including summary report of population and racial statistics).</p>
<p>The Council establishes City policies, ordinances, and land uses; approves the City's annual budget, contracts, and agreements; hears appeals of decisions made by City staff or citizen advisory groups; and appoints four Charter Officers, a City Manager, City Attorney, City Treasurer, and City Clerk. Councilmembers serve on several working committees, such as Law and Legislation, and Personnel and Public Employees. In 2002, City voters amended the City Charter and established a Compensation Commission to set the compensation for the Mayor, Council members and public members of City boards and commissions. This Charter Amendment also established the Mayor's position as a full-time job.</p>
<p>The City also has a Legislative Affairs Unit; it's primary purpose is to advocate, coordinate and advance the City's legislative agenda to enhance the City's ability to govern and provide essential municipal and community services.</p></div></div><p></p>",,"https://www.indeed.com/cmp/City-of-Sacramento,-Ca",,,,,,,,,,,,,California
