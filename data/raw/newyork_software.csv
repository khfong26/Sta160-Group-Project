<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors.

To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.</p>

<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h2>
<p>
At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the best experience, every time.</p>
<p>
Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers (humans and their best friends) with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>
You'll support a group of talented engineers and managers across &quot;pawds&quot; who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to have a direct hand in scaling the business, solving novel customer problems, and building strong relationships along the way.</p>
<p>
If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you.</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Acquisition Marketers&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How You'll Make An Impact</b></h2>
<ul><li>Guide the strategic evolution of core systems, establishing clear boundaries, leading migrations, and enabling resilient architecture that scales and adapts to business needs</li>

<li>You are able to succeed in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, naturally curious and proactive self-starter, constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and solutions</li>

<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Belonging Philosophy:</b></h2>
<p>
At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.<br>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.<br>
<br>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.<br>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.<br>
<br>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

About HERE</b></p>
<p>
Everything works right here&trade;.</p>
<p>
Traditional browsers weren't built for work. In today's enterprise environment&mdash;where security threats are constant and productivity is critical&mdash;legacy browsers fall short. That's why we built HERE, the browser purpose-built for work.</p>
<p>
Powered by Chromium, HERE Enterprise Browser combines enterprise-grade security, seamless productivity, and native AI integration in one secure, intelligent workspace. Designed for regulated industries, HERE offers deep policy controls, identity-based access, secure workspace isolation, and full interoperability across SaaS, legacy, and virtualized environments. Our platform enables teams to work faster, more securely, and more intelligently&mdash;without compromise.</p>
<p>
HERE technology is trusted by 90% of global banks and also used within the U.S. Intelligence Community and other sectors. We're backed by some of the world's most respected financial institutions and venture firms, including Bain Capital Ventures, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and IQT, the not-for-profit strategic investor that accelerates the introduction of groundbreaking technologies to enhance the national security of America and its allies.</p>
<p><b>
About the Role</b></p>
<p>
HERE is seeking a mid-junior DevOps Engineer to join our infrastructure team!

<p>
This role offers the opportunity to collaborate with senior engineers who will provide guidance and mentorship, whilst giving you ownership of projects across the DevOps lifecycle. This is an excellent platform for building practical experience with modern build engineering (CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure, and deployment practices) within a production environment.</p>

About This Role:</b></h1><p>

Data science experience, especially around clustering and anomaly detection.</p></li><li><p>
Clear and thoughtful communication on technical and strategic topics: at this stage, you'll be helping build the foundations of our company.

This project involves a shift from traditional data handling processes, with your primary focus being creating a robust application that empowers this new approach to data accessibility and decentralized ownership.</p><p></p><p><b>
About this Role:</b></p><p>
This is a high-impact, high-autonomous role is suited for a detail-oriented and collaborative individual who thrives on ownership, knows how to apply best practices, and can independently design, build, and maintain production-grade software.

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn&rsquo;t work together.<br>
<br>
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We&rsquo;re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.</p>

We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>

The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>
<br>
We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Engineering at Valon</b></h2><p>
Our engineering team is here to power the software ecosystem to disrupt one of the most outdated and regulated spaces in the financial sector - the mortgage industry. We&rsquo;ve built out the foundation of a modern mortgage servicing platform that can accurately handle billions of dollars at scale, but we&rsquo;re just getting started. At Valon, we want you to do the best work of your life. You'll be surrounded by a tight-knit community of exceptional people from places like Stripe, Jane Street, Meta, and Google who care deeply about their work and each other.

CB Insights Leadership Principles</b></p>

At CB Insights, everyone is expected to be a leader. These leadership principles are like an operating system for our culture. Use the principles as a practical guide to making decisions.
<br>
We are what we repeatedly do. By living the principles outlined below, we will build an outstanding company and do insanely great work.</p>
<div>
<ul><li><b>Solve customer problems. </b>It's our highest calling. Designing a product? Start from the customer problem it solves. Updating our sales process? Flip it around, and simplify the customer buying process.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Think BIG! Start small. </b>Great changes start with a first step. Find it. Take it. Build a system around what works. This is the secret to bringing a vision to life.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Go and see with your own eyes. </b>Meet the customer, use the product, talk to the field. Great systems aren't built from afar.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Priorities: Choose one. </b>Leaders give the gift of clarity. They find the most important thing and do it. Max power. Top speed.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Danger zones:</b>
<ul><li><b>Bureaucracy.</b> May the best ideas and execution win.</li>
<li><b>Complexity.</b> Leaders use frameworks and systems to simplify.</li>
<li><b>No commitment.</b> Leaders don't compromise just to get along. Debate. Disagree. But once a decision is made, commit.</li>
<li><b>Leaving what's important unsaid or undone.</b> No &quot;circling back.&quot;</li>
</ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Data informs. Insight transforms. </b>Pull the thread. Ask why. Leaders are curious. They use what they learn to create clarity.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Insist on excellence. </b>Leaders set high standards and overcome obstacles. They do the kind of work they're excited to share with the world.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Live off the land. </b>Leaders creatively use resources already available to them &ndash; especially AI &ndash; to execute and automate their work.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Good judgment. Leaders have it. </b>Where it comes from: insight, listening, first-hand experience. How to apply it: carefully on big, hard to reverse decisions. Swiftly on limited, easy to reverse ones.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Help others. </b>Leaders know we're building this together.</li></ul>

AWS Sales, Marketing, and Global Services (SMGS) is responsible for driving revenue, adoption, and growth from the largest and fastest growing small- and mid-market accounts to enterprise-level customers including public sector. The AWS Global Support team interacts with leading companies and believes that world-class support is critical to customer success. AWS Support also partners with a global list of customers that are building mission-critical applications on top of AWS services.<br>
<br>
Come join the AWS Marketplace Team in our mission to change the way enterprise software are bought and sold! AWS Marketplace enables software sellers to reach all AWS customers; and enables software buyers to easily discover, purchase and consume software. Our goals include enriching the platform to support more diverse selection, improving buyer and seller experience and implementing new ideas to add new dimensions to the product. Our vision is to make AWS Marketplace one stop shop for buying and selling software just like Amazon.com is for retail.<br>
<br>
We are looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to help the team take AWS Marketplace to the next level. As a Software Development Engineer on the team you will own significant portions of the product and will have significant influence on our strategy by helping define the next wave of product features and system architecture. The systems are complex and there are huge opportunities to work at all levels from the front end user experience, to a set of robust platform services, to system level pieces and everything in between. You should be somebody who enjoys working on complex system software, is customer-centric, and is passionate about building quality software as well as achieving operational excellence.
<br>
<br>
The ideal candidate will have a demonstrable track record of success delivering new features or products. This person has thrived and succeeded in delivering high quality technology products/services in a hyper-growth environment where priorities shift fast. They have design and implementation experience, knowledge of web services and protocols, and an in-depth knowledge of distributed systems architectures. Experience with asynchronous workflow systems is a plus.<br>

Inclusive Team Culture:<br>
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon&rsquo;s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.<br>
<br>
Work/Life Balance:<br>
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren&rsquo;t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don&rsquo;t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don&rsquo;t get paged for the same issue twice.<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth:<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>
