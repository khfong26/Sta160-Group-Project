&quot;I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed working at Jerry because it&rsquo;s allowed me to flex the strategy muscles I built at McKinsey while also getting much closer to implementation.

Jerry has a deeply data-driven culture. We A/B test everything, and there&rsquo;s been a big investment in data infrastructure &mdash; from clean, well-structured data to a strong data engineering team that supports real decision-making. As a result, the data and BizOps team is seen as a core strategic partner within the company.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
Another thing I&rsquo;ve appreciated is the team itself. A lot of people here come from MBB, so I&rsquo;ve still got the energy, sharp thinking, and high bar that I had at McKinsey &mdash; but now I also get to build, test, and iterate on the strategies I help develop. It&rsquo;s a great mix of ownership, rigor, and impact.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>

The ancestors of the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation existed many centuries ago as a community of people&hellip;a Tribe living together, farming, hunting and fishing to survive.<br>
<br>
Much has changed since that time. Today the Sycuan Tribe governs its Reservation, owns and operates a Casino and a Golf Resort, and owns a number of other business ventures in the San Diego Region.
<br>
<br>
One attribute that remains unchanged, however, is Sycuan's sense of community. Sycuan is more than just a business. Sycuan is a community of people working together toward a common goal. Whether you work in our state-of-the-art Casino, our beautiful Resort, or become a staff member in our Tribal Government division, you will be part of the Sycuan family.</p>

At Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, you&rsquo;ll lead product strategy for a next-generation production toolkit that puts AI superpowers directly in the hands of content creators.<br>
<br>
You&rsquo;ll define product vision and E2E workflows for an AI-powered creative suite that blends art and science, uniting pre-production, virtual production, VFX, editorial, audio, localization, and real-time iteration in a unified workspace that amplifies, not replaces, human creativity.
