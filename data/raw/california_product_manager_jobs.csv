<li><b>Delivers Great Work &amp; Works Hard - </b>You reliably ship. You make every day count and don&rsquo;t like days when nothing was made, built, or shipped. You find meaning in work and put in the effort required to win, especially in a time when competitors are working just as hard.</li>
<li><b>Technical &amp; Internet-Native - </b>You live in the medium you build. You love technology, try new products, and understand how digital culture works, what resonates, and what feels dated. You can&rsquo;t be successful with a technology you don&rsquo;t personally use and understand.</li>

<li><b>Research - </b>You can do research to understand customers, stakeholders, and what they need, think, and do. You apply the same research mindset to internal customers-what does a sales rep need? What blockers does a Marketing Generalist face?</li>

Hajoca is all about the people, who give us our advantage, and who will guide us successfully into the future.
<br><br>
Although Hajoca is a large company, we work in a decentralized environment where each of our locations, called Profit Centers (PCs), is run by the Profit Center Manager as if it were their own small business.

<li>Have a bias for action, clarity, and accountability in ambiguous environments.</li>
<li>Possess strong organizational and time management skills, with the ability to prioritize tasks effectively.</li>
<li>Be able to effectively recognize and manage risk to protect the organization.</li>

At Machina Labs, we&rsquo;re reshaping manufacturing through advanced robotics and machine learning. Our platform uses the largest 6-axis robots on the market to form 2D sheets of metal into complex 3D parts, layer-by-layer.</div><div></div><div><br>
Traditional sheet metal production was designed for scale, not flexibility. It relies on costly dies and tooling that make lower volume projects prohibitively slow and expensive. We&rsquo;re changing that. Whether you&rsquo;re a startup building a few thousand airframes or an automaker prototyping next-generation components, Machina Labs gives you the ability to iterate and manufacture at the speed of software.</div><div></div><div><br>
With support from the venture arms of Toyota, NVIDIA, and Lockheed Martin, we&rsquo;re accelerating the future of manufacturing, one where factories are flexible, production is on-demand, and innovation is unconstrained.<br>
</div><div></div><br>
<div><b>About the Role</b></div><div></div><div><br>
As a Product Management Intern at Machina Labs, you will take ownership of high-impact projects that advance the future of flexible manufacturing. You'll collaborate across engineering, robotics, and machine learning teams to deliver real solutions for customers, helping make industrial-grade metal forming accessible to all. This role empowers you to develop core product management skills, drive meaningful business outcomes, and contribute directly to Machina Labs&rsquo; mission of democratizing manufacturing through innovation.</div><div></div><div><br>
Product management isn&rsquo;t taught in most universities, it&rsquo;s learned by doing. This internship gives you that opportunity. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our product team and own a meaningful piece of our product from start to finish. This is not a shadow role or a fluff project&mdash;you&rsquo;ll take full ownership of work that matters to our business and our customers.</div>
<h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>What You&rsquo;ll Do</b></h3><ul><li>
Partner with internal and external customers to understand their needs.</li><li>
Define and design software and hardware solutions that address real user problems.</li><li>
Collaborate with engineers to deliver those solutions into production.</li><li>
Contribute to product roadmapping meetings and learn how product strategies are developed and maintained.</li><li>
Participate in technical planning and sprint management across Robotics, Software, Machine Learning, Automation, and Mechanical Engineering teams.</li></ul><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We're Looking For
</b></h3><ul><li>Currently pursuing or holding a degree in engineering or a closely related technical field (B.S., M.S., or Ph.D.).</li><li>
Expected to complete or have completed final degree within one year of the internship&rsquo;s end.</li><li>
Analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to quickly understand technical domains.
</li><li>Familiarity with technical concepts in the fields of robotics, AI, or manufacturing systems.</li><li>
Interest in business, design, and engineering disciplines. Product sits at the intersection of all three.</li><li>
Clear, structured communication skills&mdash;able to translate between technical and non-technical audiences.</li><li>
Self-motivated and independent. Product managers own broad problem spaces&mdash;they research, design, and drive outcomes with limited direction.</li></ul><div>
Machina Labs is an Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity employer and considers all applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or status as a protected veteran in accordance with state and federal law.</div><div></div><div><br>

<br>
The Apple Services Engineering (ASE) team is one of the most exciting examples of Apple&rsquo;s long-held passion for combining art and technology. These are the people who power the App Store, Apple TV, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books. And they do it on a massive scale, meeting Apple&rsquo;s high expectations with high performance to deliver a huge variety of entertainment in over 35 languages to more than 150 countries.<br>
<br>
<b>Description</b><br>
<br>
Our team, ASE Privacy Instrumentation, works with Apple's customer-facing app development teams to answer two key questions: what metrics should we collect to answer key business questions and how will we get those metrics from client devices? We design and develop the data schema and standards for metrics, as well as the tooling that enables teams to collect these metrics, all while keeping user privacy front and center. By joining us your innovative ideas will impact billions of users worldwide and you will contribute to Apple&rsquo;s magic.<br>
<br>
We're looking for someone who thrives at the intersection of product management and engineering, helping us solve problems critical to unlocking business insights on Apple's most important customer software. In this role, you'll define the future of our privacy-first instrumentation capabilities while maintaining hands-on engineering involvement. This isn't your standard engineering role: while you will get the opportunity to write code for our tooling and data infrastructure, the bulk of your time will be focused on technical design, requirements gathering, and cross-functional collaboration.<br>
<br>
You&rsquo;ll be tasked with designing, launching, and supporting new data infrastructure products as necessary to answer high-level analytics questions at scale.<br>
<br>
Your responsibilities will span the full software development lifecycle - from brainstorming, design and analysis to development, implementation and maintenance. You'll define strategies for new data infrastructure products, create and maintain detailed instrumentation specifications for all new features across ASE products, and contribute code to implement these strategies.<br>
<br>
Working with stakeholders across product, engineering, data science, privacy, legal, and QA teams, you will:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Design and implement privacy-preserving analytics systems some of Apple&rsquo;s flagship software products</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Design and develop frameworks and tools to collect analytics data across all Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, web, and third-party)</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Own the end-to-end product lifecycle for client instrumentation capabilities, creating specifications for engineering, data science, and QA teams</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Serve as data collection subject-matter expert, advising stakeholders on analytics impact across systems</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Partner with privacy and legal teams to balance analytics needs with consumer privacy protection</li></ul><br>
The people here at Apple don&rsquo;t just create products - they create the kind of wonder that&rsquo;s revolutionized entire industries. It&rsquo;s the diversity of those people and their ideas that inspires the innovation that runs through everything we do, from amazing technology to industry-leading environmental efforts. Join Apple, and help us leave the world better than we found it.<br>
<br>
<b>Preferred Qualifications</b><br>
<br>
Ability to assist in the creation and enforcement of privacy and compliance policies and guidelines across ASE and Apple<br>
<br>
Industry experience in Privacy-Enhancing Technologies for large-scale distributed systems<br>
<br>
Experience with differential privacy, private data-synchronization across systems and devices, data minimization, tokenization, cryptography<br>
<br>
<b>Minimum Qualifications</b><br>
<br>
3+ years of experience as a software engineer, technical product manager, or engineering-focused management consultant<br>
<br>
Strong software design skills with deep knowledge of data structures and algorithms and hands on experience with programming languages such as Swift, Objective-C, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, TypeScript, React, Angular, Ember, Vue<br>
<br>
BS/MS in Computer Science or equivalent industry experience with iOS and/or web development<br>
<br>
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with ability to translate ambiguous analytics questions into concrete engineering requirements while working with large, distributed cross-functional teams<br>

The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>

</p><p>Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that&rsquo;s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications &ndash; without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit.

We are seeking a strategic, hands-on Head of Product to own the unified vision and execution for our product management (and to an extent, product marketing) functions. This is not a management and delegation role, this is a in-the-weeds product role with both strategic and operational components.

<b>Our Approach to Flexible Work<br>
</b><br>
</p><p>With Flex Work, we&rsquo;re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply <b>spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field </b>with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote &quot;home office&quot; roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

Are you an experienced technologist who loves helping bring product value propositions to life via great storytelling?

We might have just the right role for you.<br>
<br>
AWS is the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Product Marketing is a critical part of making sure that we are building the right products for our customers and creating crisp and differentiated value propositions that form the core of our storytelling efforts. Product Marketing managers work closely with our customers, product and field account teams, 3rd party analysts, press, and many others. We synthesize multiple diverse perspectives and &ldquo;connect the dots&rdquo; between customers and various different AWS capabilities as we build and launch compelling new services.<br>
<br>
In this role, you will leverage your own deep experience as a technologist as you lead a team of Product Marketing Managers responsible for AWS serverless, containers, and compute infrastructure. You will enable your team to work backwards and get the right customer insights, to stay sharp and deep on industry and product trends, and to synthesize all this data into meaningful information that informs our product roadmap and gets baked into the differentiated value propositions that your team creates. Your team will define the strategy for product launch and adoption and integrate efforts more broadly with other marketing and field teams across the company so that we can maximize customer awareness, adoption, and retention of products that will exceed the expectations of users. Your team will lead the creation of the most compelling assets that tell our story whether that&rsquo;s presentations, demos, videos, and so on.

<br>
We are looking for builders who have experience working directly with customers, analyzing and synthesizing data from multiple sources, and who thrive both when working closely with engineering teams to influence product outcomes and building value propositions that will educate customers on the value that technology can bring to them. In particular, we are looking for individuals who can operate at both a broad and deep level; who can understand our technology with the same depth that our customers do, and who can think like a technologist and a business leader simultaneously.<br>
