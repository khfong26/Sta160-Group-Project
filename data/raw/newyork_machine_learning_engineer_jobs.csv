CB Insights Leadership Principles</b></p>
<p>
At CB Insights, everyone is expected to be a leader. These leadership principles are like an operating system for our culture. Use the principles as a practical guide to making decisions.
<br>
We are what we repeatedly do. By living the principles outlined below, we will build an outstanding company and do insanely great work.</p>
<div>
<ul><li><b>Solve customer problems. </b>It's our highest calling. Designing a product? Start from the customer problem it solves. Updating our sales process? Flip it around, and simplify the customer buying process.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Think BIG! Start small. </b>Great changes start with a first step. Find it. Take it. Build a system around what works. This is the secret to bringing a vision to life.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Go and see with your own eyes. </b>Meet the customer, use the product, talk to the field. Great systems aren't built from afar.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Priorities: Choose one. </b>Leaders give the gift of clarity. They find the most important thing and do it. Max power. Top speed.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Danger zones:</b>
<ul><li><b>Bureaucracy.</b> May the best ideas and execution win.</li>
<li><b>Complexity.</b> Leaders use frameworks and systems to simplify.</li>
<li><b>No commitment.</b> Leaders don't compromise just to get along. Debate. Disagree. But once a decision is made, commit.</li>
<li><b>Leaving what's important unsaid or undone.</b> No &quot;circling back.&quot;</li>
</ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Data informs. Insight transforms. </b>Pull the thread. Ask why. Leaders are curious. They use what they learn to create clarity.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Insist on excellence. </b>Leaders set high standards and overcome obstacles. They do the kind of work they're excited to share with the world.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Live off the land. </b>Leaders creatively use resources already available to them &ndash; especially AI &ndash; to execute and automate their work.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Good judgment. Leaders have it. </b>Where it comes from: insight, listening, first-hand experience. How to apply it: carefully on big, hard to reverse decisions. Swiftly on limited, easy to reverse ones.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Help others. </b>Leaders know we're building this together.</li></ul>

Basis is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.</p><p>
The first is to <b>understand and build intelligence.</b> This means to establish the mathematical principles of what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct software that implements these principles.</p><p>
The second is to <b>advance society&rsquo;s ability to solve intractable problems</b>. This means expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.</p><p>
To achieve these goals, we&rsquo;re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
About the Role</b></h1><p>
Research scientists lead Basis&rsquo; efforts to develop a deeper understanding of the conceptual, mathematical, and computational principles of intelligence.</p><p>
We are looking for people who are technically excellent, and who value probing concepts at their foundations. Our research scientists/engineers aspire to do rigorous, high-quality, robust science, but are not afraid to tinker, make mistakes, and explore radically different ideas in order to get there.</p><p>
Basis is a collaborative effort, both internally and with our external partners; we are looking for people who enjoy working with others on problems larger than ones they can tackle alone.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Research Focus</b></h2><p>
Despite the increasing recognition that both having and discovering world models are central to intelligence, current AI systems struggle to replicate this human capability. There remains significant uncertainty about what precisely constitutes a world model, how we might reliably detect if an agent possesses one, and crucially, how we can develop agents that learn these models rapidly and reliably.</p><p>
Our research within the MARA project aims to develop new foundations and technologies for modeling, abstraction, and reasoning in AI systems. MARA&rsquo;s overarching goal is to uncover principled methods for how intelligence constructs, refines, and utilizes world models through interactive experimentation. Building these systems will demand advances in knowledge representation, abstraction, reasoning, active learning, reinforcement learning, and a first-principles rethinking of what it means to model the world.</p><p>
The immediate mission of MARA is to solve concrete challenges such as AutumnBench, physical and simulated robotics benchmarks, and the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC), with the broader mission of building systems capable of learning in an open, growing portfolio of domains using human-comparable amounts of data and interaction.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Who we&rsquo;re looking for</b></h2><ul><li><p>
Researchers holding a PhD in computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cognitive science, or related fields.</p></li><li><p>
Strong background in areas such as program synthesis, probabilistic programming, machine learning, AI reasoning systems, and cognitive modeling.</p></li><li><p>
Experience in developing AI systems that combine neural and symbolic methods is highly valued.</p></li><li><p>
Interest in foundational AI research and its applications to modeling, abstraction, and reasoning.</p></li><li><p>
Individuals with a demonstrated track record in scientific research, evidenced through publications, technical reports, or impactful software projects.</p></li><li><p>
Excited about solving real world problems and having positive societal impact.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Responsibilities</b></h2><ul><li><p>

Apply these methods to concrete challenges such as AutumnBench, physical and simulated robotics environments, the Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and other domains.</p></li><li><p>

Provide mentorship to junior team members and contribute to the scientific discourse through seminars, workshops, and collaborative projects.</p></li><li><p>

What You'll Do</p><ul><li>
Closely collaborate with research scientists. Work side-by-side to turn new research ideas into well-engineered experiments, ensuring efficiency, clarity, and reproducibility in every implementation.</li><li>
Improve model training pipelines. You&rsquo;ll debug distributed training, optimize data loading at massive scale, and ensure smooth scaling across compute environments.</li><li>
Optimize performance. You&rsquo;ll profile and accelerate existing training and inference code to make experiments faster and production systems more responsive.</li><li>
Integrate models into production environments. You&rsquo;ll work directly with platform and product teams to deploy models into the hands of hundreds of millions of Spotify&rsquo;s users.</li><li>
Incorporate state-of-the-art research. You'll translate models and techniques described in the literature into robust, well-engineered prototypes.</li><li>
Maintain a high-quality codebase. You&rsquo;ll enforce clear structure, consistency, and testing practices to support long-term maintainability on a codebase shared between members of a fast-paced globally distributed team.</li><li>
Enhance researcher experience. You&rsquo;ll build internal tooling, libraries, and workflows to make experimentation, debugging, and deployment more efficient for the whole team.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><p>
Who You Are</p><ul><li>
You have experience training or fine-tuning large machine learning models on GPUs using PyTorch or similar frameworks.</li><li>
You have experience working with cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform, AWS, or Microsoft Azure.</li><li>
You understand how to debug problems in machine learning training code.</li><li>
You communicate effectively with global teams and are ready to work both face-to-face and asynchronously with collaborators on multiple continents.</li><li>
You have experience optimizing code for performance and can make GPUs &ldquo;go brrr&rdquo; (train at maximum efficiency).</li><li>
You learn new concepts and technologies quickly and keep up to date with the rapid pace of development in machine learning and AI.</li><li>
You are resourceful and proactive; when faced with blockers, you seek out solutions through research, experimentation, and collaboration.</li><li>
You&rsquo;re not afraid to dig deep into the stack: working with lldb, NVIDIA Nsight, or other low-level debugging tools is a plus.</li><li>
You have a solid grasp of computer science concepts like type systems, compilers, parallelism, thread safety, encapsulation, and the like.</li><li>
You have an interest in learning more about audio processing and music information retrieval and you're excited about building amazing products that use these technologies.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><p>

We are seeking a Senior Research Scientist to join our Artist-First AI Music lab. Our team pioneers and advances state-of-the-art generative technologies for music that create breakthrough experiences for fans and artists. We invent entirely new listening experiences that center and celebrate artists and creatives. All of our products will put artists and songwriters first, through these four principles:</div></div><div><div><div><br>
</div><div>Partnerships with record labels, distributors, and music publishers: We&rsquo;ll develop new products for artists and fans through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness later.</div><div>
Choice in participation: We recognize there&rsquo;s a wide range of views on use of generative music tools within the artistic community. Therefore, artists and rightsholders will choose if and how to participate to ensure the use of AI tools aligns with the values of the people behind the music.</div><div>
Fair compensation and new revenue: We will build products that create wholly new revenue streams for rightsholders, artists, and songwriters, ensuring they are properly compensated for uses of their work and transparently credited for their contributions.</div><div>
Artist-fan connection: AI tools we develop will not replace human artistry. They will give artists new ways to be creative and connect with fans. We will leverage our role as the place where more than 700 million people already come to listen to music every month to ensure that generative AI deepens artist-fan connections.</div><div><br>
