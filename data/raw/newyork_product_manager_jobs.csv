About Tomorrow Health</b></p>
<p>
Tomorrow Health enables exceptional healthcare for patients and their families in the place they want to be most &mdash; home.

Tomorrow Health connects patients, providers, health plans, and home-based care suppliers, to ensure patients receive the correct and timely care they need to remain healthy at home.</p>
<p>
We believe that a team's strength is in its people. Our goal is to raise the industry standard for patient experience, and we realize this cannot be achieved without a team that reflects the vast diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and set of experiences and perspectives of the patients we serve. We believe in putting patients first, that many perspectives are stronger than one, and in treating those we serve just as we would our own family members. If you're passionate about improving healthcare delivery, leveraging technology to serve people, and working in a collaborative, diverse environment, we hope you'll join us.</p>

Help us build the most accurate insightful AI for insurance.</p><p><b>
The Role</b></p><p>
We&rsquo;re hiring our first Product Manager to join our founding team.

Applecart</b> is the leading technology company that C-suites rely on to reach business-critical decision makers. The most important decisions are made by the hardest people to reach and influence. Historically, C-suite leaders have lacked the tools to reach the stakeholders who matter most to their business. The C-suites of hundreds of Fortune 500 companies, major agencies, trade associations, nonprofits, and governments use Applecart to put their best content in front of business-critical decision makers and those they trust &mdash; from policymakers and investors to CEOs, key employees, members of the media and more. Decision makers are informed by what they read, learn from advisors, hear from colleagues, and discuss with family and friends. To break through to them, you must reach them through the only channel that really moves them: those they know and trust. Applecart's platform uses publicly available data to map billions of social relationships between nearly every American adult and enable clients to deliver content directly to decision makers and those who matter most to them.</p>

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>
<br>
We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Drive initiatives end-to-end: from ideation, discovery, scoping, to launch, adoption, and iteration.</p></li><li><p>

<b>Who We Are:</b><br>
The Fund for Public Health in New York City (FPHNYC) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that is dedicated to the advancement of the health and well-being of all New Yorkers. To this end, in partnership with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), FPHNYC incubates innovative public health initiatives implemented by DOHMH to advance community health throughout the city. It facilitates partnerships, often new and unconventional, between government and the private sector to develop, test, and launch new initiatives. These collaborations speed the execution of demonstration projects, effect expansion of successful pilot programs, and support rapid implementation to meet the public health needs of individuals, families, and communities across New York City.
<br><br>
<b>Our Culture:</b><br>
We embrace a culture of learning, collaboration, innovation, and well-being, where open communication drives our impact.
<br><br>
<b>About The Role:</b><br>
DOHMH is building its Enterprise Data Platform to increase its capacity to ingest, process, clean, analyze, and communicate data as a valuable resource. This resource will help the agency make decisions based on the best available information, to lead public health policy, and make operational decisions that optimally support the health of New Yorkers, especially vulnerable populations. The work will be done collaboratively with programmatic and administrative divisions and bureaus in the agency.
<br>The primary goal of the Bureau of Data Technology and Strategy is to implement the agency’s Enterprise Data Platform, on Microsoft’s Azure Cloud, using Databricks. The person in this role will collaborate closely with the Executive Director of Data Ecosystem and Strategy to plan and execute the rollout of the Enterprise Data Platform.
<br>The Bureau of Data Technology and Strategy seeks an Executive Director of Product Management and Engineering, to lead its product management team. The position will report to the Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau of Data Technology and Strategy, directly supervise a number of product and engineering managers, who lead interdependent teams. This person will also work closely with partners from the Division of Information Technology, who manage the agency’s technology and cloud infrastructure, and will collaborate with public health programs in the agency.
<br><br>
<b>About the Program:</b><br>
As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises - from New York City's yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic - we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.
<br>The Center for Population Health Data Science (CPHDS)- launched in October of 2023- aims to catalyze critical data modernization work and enable the agency to make progress toward linking public health, healthcare, and social service for timely and effective public action. We are working towards making these data more accessible, timely, equitable, meaningfully usable, and protected – and actively used to protect and promote the health and wellbeing of New Yorkers.
<br>We aim to strengthen agency wide data capabilities by empowering our workforce, enhancing intra- and inter-agency data sharing, and using modern technology to yield trusted and integrated data and insights. A real-time and comprehensive view of city needs is needed to enhance public health actions and improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable New Yorkers.

<b>Eagle</b> is an AI holding company with a simple mission: bolster American resilience by creating the next-gen engineering services firm.</p><p><br>
Today American infrastructure faces no shortage of challenges &mdash; from natural disaster risk and climate change to outright age and deterioration.<br>
<br>
The problem is that the way we design infrastructure is stuck in the past.<br>
<br>
Engineers today spend most of their time bogged down in documentation, clunky CAD software, and manual workflows &mdash; acting more like back-office admin than inventive builders.<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re on a mission to change that.<br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re acquiring and partnering with the best engineering design firms &mdash; civil, structural, environmental, MEP, and more &mdash; to embed AI at the core of their operations and create the engineering firm of the future.<br>
<br>
<b>About the Role</b><br>
As an <b>Embedded Product Manager (EPM)</b> at Eagle, you will collaborate with a team of engineers and researchers to define how a company reinvents themselves with AI.</p><ul><li><p>
EPMs shape AI transformation strategies that executives can believe in, teams are excited by, and that can create outsized value.</p></li><li><p>
We care deeply about delivering real outcomes: ensuring that products are adopted, loved and scaled, without shying away from the complexity of real data and real users.</p></li><li><p>
We are creative problem solvers and relentlessly practical: we continuously iterate towards finding the right long-term and short-term tradeoffs, running experiments to validate value and understanding when to leverage our research team for when we need to push the envelope.</p></li><li><p>
As an early EPM team member you&rsquo;ll play a huge part in shaping which customers we target, the product abstractions we invest in and the culture of how we build together.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Responsibilities</b></p><p>
This is a lead role with outsized responsibility. The work will range from shaping and executing the AI vision of a engineering firm to directing a team of world-class researchers.</p><ul><li><p>
Collaborate with customer stakeholders to define their long-term AI strategy and transformation roadmap.</p></li><li><p>
Work backwards from the long-term vision to prioritize specific use cases that connect our ambition to immediate business value.</p></li><li><p>
Deliver high value workflows by leveraging partners and building greenfield products.</p></li><li><p>
Design high-value workflows with our engineers and researchers.</p></li><li><p>
Iterate quickly based on user feedback and partner closely with stakeholders to ensure what we build is loved and trusted.</p></li><li><p>
Create systems to quantify the impact of our work and tie to top-level business impact</p></li><li><p>
Translate learnings into reusable playbooks that help us drive faster change with future customers.</p></li></ul><p>
If you&rsquo;re excited by the idea of being embedded inside companies at their most pivotal moments, shaping how AI evolves a business, and seeing your work drive tangible transformation in weeks, not years, then let&rsquo;s chat.</p><p></p><p><b>
Profiles we&rsquo;ve seen thrive in this role</b></p><ul><li><p><b>
Former founders</b> who want high ownership and extremely high leverage outcomes.</p></li><li><p><b>
Former engineers</b> who are drawn towards scaling their impact in a more product-forward role (while still being able to build the 0 1 prototype on occasion)</p></li><li><p><b>
Ex-consultants</b> who enjoy strategy but crave less red tape and more rapid and iterative implementation</p></li><li><p><b>
Product managers</b> who want to work on ambitious problems with high-charisma, generative engineers</p></li></ul><p>
The list is by no means exhaustive and we intentionally do not want to limit ourselves to the experience above. That said, if any of the above does sound like you then we think you might love it here.</p><p></p><p><b>
You may be a good fit if you</b></p><ul><li><p>
Have a proven track record of executing end-to-end on large and complex products in ambiguous environments</p></li><li><p>
Abstract complex systems into the right level of clarity, whether for end-users, engineers, or executives.</p></li><li><p>
Are motivated by working on high leverage, impactful problems in industries that matter</p></li><li><p>
Exhibit extreme agency and bias towards action. You are fundamentally a &ldquo;so instead I...&rdquo; person</p></li><li><p>
Are fundamentally excited about the potential for AI to transform businesses and understand the gap between what is needed and existing offerings (pure product or consulting companies)</p></li><li><p>
Hands-on experience with LLMs, or the drive to quickly get up to speed</p></li><li><p>
Bring subject matter expertise or particular interest in engineering services</p></li></ul><p><br>

About Fanatics Collectibles</b></p>
<p>
Fanatics Collectibles is building the future of trading cards&mdash;and scaling fast. Our licenses span MLB, NBA, NFL, Premier League, UEFA, WWE, UFC, and more. To power this growth, we&rsquo;re investing in modern internal platforms that serve as the digital backbone of our business&mdash;from card design and production to fulfillment and distribution.

<ul><li>Build the CollectiblesOS portal: Launch a central, role-aware AI-powered hub for all internal custom tooling and business insights &amp; dashboarding.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Prototype &amp; iterate: Use low/no-code and AI workflow automation tools (Retool, Zapier, n8n, Glean, etc.) to test and ship MVPs rapidly.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Drive build-vs-buy rigor: When internal builds aren&rsquo;t the right choice (i.e., due to feasibility, speed to market, costs), lead vendor evaluations, negotiate modular solutions, and ensure clean integration with our data and AI platforms.</li></ul>

You bring both strategic thinking and a hands-on approach &mdash; connecting Capsule&rsquo;s long-term vision to immediate product decisions that move the business forward.</p></li><li><p>
You ground your decisions in data and use it to guide others, whether by extracting insights through analysis (SQL skills are a strong plus), synthesizing user research, or navigating ambiguity with structured problem-solving.</p></li><li><p>
You are curious and open-minded, always asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; and pushing beyond the obvious answer to uncover the real drivers of impact.</p></li><li><p>
You check your ego at the door. You are interested in finding the right answer vs. always having the right answer and always bring out the best in your team by helping to align people around common objectives.</p></li><li><p>
You operate with an ownership mindset &mdash; taking responsibility for outcomes and expecting the same commitment from your teammates.</p></li></ul>
