The ancestors of the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation existed many centuries ago as a community of people&hellip;a Tribe living together, farming, hunting and fishing to survive.<br>
<br>
Much has changed since that time. Today the Sycuan Tribe governs its Reservation, owns and operates a Casino and a Golf Resort, and owns a number of other business ventures in the San Diego Region.
