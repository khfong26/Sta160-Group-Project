<br>
Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23. In 1938 he learned the m&eacute;tier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p></p>",Retail,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Christian-Dior,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/dad2d4518ae5ab7218bebf0c965b2646,https://www.dior.com/,"30 avenue Montaigne, 75008 Paris","1,001 to 5,000",$500M to $1B (USD),,,,,,,,New York

Your work here has meaning. You're here to improve the lives of coworkers, guests, owners, communities, and together we make that happen. It's what drives all that we do. Every day you can improve lives in your own, unique way and you can expect the same in return. It all starts with you.</p>

About Hiscox:</div><div>

Scratch beneath the surface and you will find a business that is solid, but slightly contrary. We like to do things differently and constantly seek to evolve. We might have been around for a long time (our roots go back to 1901), but we are young in many ways, ambitious and going places.</div><div>
Some people might say insurance is dull, but life at Hiscox is anything but. If that sounds good to you, get in touch.</div><div></div><div>

About Send</b></p>
<p>
In 2017, Send was founded by Andy Moss, Ben Huckel, and Matt McGrillis with a vision to reshape and enhance the underwriting process for commercial insurers-combining advanced technology with deep industry expertise.</p>
<p>
By 2019, we had delivered a commercial and specialty Underwriting Workbench for a leading global insurer-one of the UK's top five composite insurers and a major FTSE 100 carrier. This solution streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and enabled forward visibility.</p>
<p>
In 2022, we won three industry awards for the Underwriting Workbench and raised $10 million in Series A funding to support our expansion in the UK and US.</p>
<p>
The following year, in 2023, we launched Smart Submission, a stand-alone component of the Underwriting Workbench, and were named a <i>Leader</i> in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide P&amp;C Intelligent Underwriting Workbench Applications Vendor Assessment.</p>
<p>
In 2024, we were recognised as a <i>Top Provider</i> in the Datos P&amp;C Workbench report and named a <i>Leader</i> in Celent's Underwriting Workbench reports for both North America and Global Markets.</p>
<p>
Our vision is to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile carriers.<br>
<b>#loveunderwriting</b></p><br>
<p></p>
<p><b>
Our Funding</b></p>
<p>
From 2017 to 2022, we bootstrapped our growth journey, building a profitable and stable company. In November 2022, following a year of strong customer and team growth, we secured $10 million in Series A funding to accelerate our expansion across the UK and US, as well as to further enhance our product development. We're proud to have the support and expertise of our investors, Mercia and Breega.</p>

We are now preparing for our Series B round and are excited about the growth acceleration this will enable.</p><br>
