You'll also work closely with our architecture and design teams to drive hardware/software co-design, developing both firmware and custom hardware that enables ML within our accelerator chips. Our team's charter is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday software developers and to democratize access to industry leading infrastructure - you'll be enabling that vision from the ground up.
