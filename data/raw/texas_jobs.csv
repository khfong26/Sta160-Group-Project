When it comes to workplace structure, we believe in balancing individual flexibility and community connections. It&rsquo;s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees &ndash; in partnership with their manager &ndash; can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs.

In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here&rsquo;s what that means for you: we&rsquo;re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve <b>G</b>oals, achieve <b>R</b>esults within their job responsibilities, contribute <b>I</b>nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader <b>T</b>eam through collaboration and attitude.</p><p></p><p>

What Makes Cloudflare Special?</b></p>
<p>
We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.</p>
<p><b>
Project Galileo</b>: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost.</p>
<p><b>
Athenian Project</b>: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.</p>
<p><b>
1.1.1.1</b>: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.</p>

Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p><b>

Examples of our projects:</p>
We built an agentic AI solution that redefined event information access for a global technology leader, delivering instant, accurate answers to attendee questions at scale. Using Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and Azure Machine Learning, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we engineered a secure, multilingual Copilot platform capable of processing data from 22 file formats across multiple sources. Our team leveraged Azure Databricks for advanced data transformation, Azure Front Door for global load balancing, and Microsoft Entra ID with Azure Key Vault for enterprise-grade security. The result: a system that served over 200,000 users, handled millions of interactions, and reduced support requests by 70%, setting a new benchmark for scalable, intelligent, and personalized event experiences.<br>
<ul><li>
</li>
We built a high-performance reporting solution that redefined data refresh efficiency for a leading office supply retailer, delivering near real-time insights and dramatically faster report access. By integrating Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables into Microsoft Fabric via OneLake shortcuts and leveraging Power BI&rsquo;s Direct Lake mode, we built a scalable architecture that eliminated data duplication and significantly reduced latency. Our team leveraged Azure Data Lake Storage for external volume dumps, semantic modeling for streamlined analytics, and Fabric F256 SKU with autoscale for optimized compute. The result: report load times dropped by 80%, refresh cycles shrank from 10 days to minutes, and infrastructure costs fell by 60%, setting a new benchmark for enterprise-grade reporting performance.<br>
<li>
</li>
We helped a global industrial technology leader transform its construction operations by replacing a fragmented, batch-based ERP system with a real-time intelligence solution built on Microsoft Fabric. The previous setup&mdash;based on Databricks and Snowflake&mdash;struggled with delayed data updates, high maintenance, and siloed systems. By implementing Microsoft Fabric&rsquo;s Real-Time Intelligence capabilities, including Eventstreams, Reflex, and Power BI dashboards, we enabled real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, and instant insights. The result: 20&ndash;30% cost savings, 50% less IT maintenance, and a 10x improvement in data latency. This empowered faster decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and a more agile, data-driven organization.<br>
<li>
</li>
We helped a Fortune 500 office supply retailer modernize its reporting by migrating from MicroStrategy to Power BI. The legacy system was costly and inefficient, requiring over 150 duplicate reports and individual licenses for each user. Our solution consolidated these into just five dynamic Power BI reports, each customizable with bookmarks and filters. By leveraging Snowflake and Import Mode, we delivered a scalable semantic model and a user-friendly experience. The result: reduced license costs, faster reporting, and empowered business users with self-service analytics.<br>
<li>
</li><li>
We built an AI-powered chatbot for a global manufacturer of industrial test and diagnostic equipment to improve access to project lifecycle management data. Using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure App Service, the solution indexed documents from SharePoint&mdash;including PDFs, Excel files, and dynamic web pages&mdash;into a centralized, searchable interface. Power Automate and custom code streamlined data ingestion and processing, while Azure Cosmos DB stored historical interactions. The chatbot enabled employees to retrieve accurate insights quickly, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making. Post-deployment, the client achieved higher productivity, lower operational costs, and seamless access to project data through a single unified interface.</li></ul><p>

<p>
SafetyChain is building the next generation of enterprise software for the supply chain&mdash;systems that actually help operators think, decide, and act in real time. We&rsquo;re assembling a senior engineering group in the <b>Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth metroplex </b>to build this platform from the ground up using a modern, AI-first development environment.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Who We Are</b></p>
<p>
SafetyChain is a fast-growing B2B SaaS software company. Our industry leading Plant Management Platform helps manufacturers improve yield, maximize productivity, and ensure compliance throughout their operations.</p>
<p>
Headquartered in Novato, CA, we have a passionate, diverse team with the majority of our employees working remotely across the country to serve our customers. We operate with the fun and flexibility of a start-up combined with the stability of a mature and rapidly growing software company.</p><p></p><p><br>
Our solutions are used every day in thousands of facilities to help our customers make their products better and safer. Customers include many well-known brands like Albertsons, Clif Bar, Driscoll&rsquo;s, Schwan&rsquo;s, See&rsquo;s Candies, Tyson Foods, United Airlines, WholeFoods and White Castle. We believe our culture of &ldquo;Help and Hustle&rdquo; makes for a great place to work and we foster a dynamic, positive environment that enables our teams to put their creative energies towards solving our customers&rsquo; problems and supporting each other. Our culture is real, tangible and immensely rewarding.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
What You&rsquo;ll Do</b></p>
<p>
You&rsquo;ll help design and build the foundations of SafetyChain&rsquo;s next-gen platform&mdash;enterprise-grade, AI-enabled, and capable of supporting a wide range of operational workflows across the food &amp; beverage supply chain. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building high-performance services and applications in an end-to-end TypeScript environment (Deno backend + unified front-end framework).</li>
<li>Working in a monorepo with strong engineering conventions and automated tooling to accelerate iteration.</li>
<li>Using AI-driven developer workflows (code generation, scaffolding, automated tests, modeling, inference-based data mapping, etc.) to dramatically speed up delivery.</li>
<li>Making pragmatic architectural decisions&mdash;knowing when to build, when to buy, and when to rely on the surrounding ecosystem.</li>
<li>Designing systems where platforms emerge from real demand rather than speculative abstraction.</li>
<li>Contributing to an &ldquo;office-first when collaboration matters&rdquo; culture that values high-bandwidth problem solving and clear ownership.</li>
<li>Building enterprise-scale features with attention to reliability, data semantics, and real-world operational constraints.</li>
<li>Partnering closely with Product and AI/ML teams to translate domain complexity into clean, scalable systems.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>What You Bring</b></p>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t need to show up as a TypeScript or Deno expert&mdash;but you must be the kind of engineer who can learn fast, adapt faster, and enjoy working with modern tooling.</p><p></p><p><b><br>
Core Experience</b></p>
<ul>
<li>8+ years building modern web applications or distributed systems (enterprise experience strongly preferred).</li>
<li>Strong background in at least one of: TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, or C#.</li>
<li>Experience with multiple data storage models&mdash;document, columnar, relational&mdash;and clear reasoning about tradeoffs.</li>
<li>Ability to design and debug systems that operate at real-world scale and complexity.</li>
<li>A practical mindset: you don&rsquo;t reinvent authentication, messaging, or streaming engines unless there&rsquo;s a <i>damned good reason</i>.</li>
<li>Comfort with hybrid work and in-office collaboration for high-context problem-solving.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>Full-Stack Engineers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience building and maintaining APIs, data pipelines, or backend primitives.</li>
<li>Strong architectural intuition around distributed systems, eventing, and state management.</li>
<li>Ability to design clean contracts between backend and frontend.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>Frontend-Focused Engineers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Deep understanding of frontend state, caching, offline behavior, and storage semantics.</li>
<li>Experience building rich, responsive interfaces for enterprise or operational users.</li>
<li>Ability to work with cross-platform UI scaffolding for web, tablet, and desktop environments.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>How You Think (the part we screen hardest for)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re allergic to cargo-cult engineering and prefer reasoning from first principles.</li>
<li>You default to outcome-based decisions instead of theoretical purity.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t chase platform work for its own sake&mdash;platforms should <i>emerge</i> from repeated need.</li>
<li>You care about simplicity, legibility, and solving the right problem.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re energized by a team of peers who challenge each other and move fast.</li><br>
</ul>
<p><b>Why Join Now</b></p>
<p>
You&rsquo;d be joining at the moment the &ldquo;next-gen SafetyChain&rdquo; becomes real. You&rsquo;ll influence architecture, tooling, culture, AI-assisted workflows, and the entire development model. The team will be senior, tight-knit, and design-driven.

<br>
This position is for a Software Engineer for the AWS Neuron SDK team with a deep background in Linux and device drivers. Deep knowledge and experience with hardware-based accelerator platforms (such as encryption, TCP offload, storage accelerators and router/switch platforms) and the necessary complexity for the software layers that interact and manage them. Experience implementing high performance software drivers, needed to ensure high throughput from software to hardware, is also a necessity. This engineer will work with the team to define the key interfaces and will develop the runtime stack and driver that manages the accelerator.<br>
