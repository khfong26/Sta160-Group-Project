It&rsquo;s through our flexible work benefit, Scribd Flex, that employees &ndash; in partnership with their manager &ndash; can choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs.

About Us</b></p><p></p><p>
Senseye is a NeuroTechnology Company in Austin, TX on the cusp of revolutionizing Mental Health. Over the past 6 years we have invested millions of dollars in R&amp;D to build our platform allowing us to measure cognitive activity via the eye through mobile phones. Through multiple iterations and use cases we are now focused on building the world's first objective mental health diagnostic on top of our core technology. Our first diagnostic is for PTSD and is entering clinical trials now, followed soon by additional indications for Anxiety and Depression. As the world struggles with a mental health crisis, it is not hyperbolic to suggest that an objective diagnostic platform, that gives clinicians a safe and objective accurate approach to identifying and monitoring mental health disease, will redefine how mental health services are provided, and will enable access to treatment for millions of sufferers. The Senseye platform has the potential to be the technology that drives this change. This is a great opportunity to shape the future of digital medicine and address unmet medical needs that affect billions of people worldwide.</p><p><b>

Annapurna Labs designs silicon and software that accelerates innovation. Customers choose us to create cloud solutions that solve challenges that were unimaginable a short time ago&mdash;even yesterday. Our custom chips, accelerators, and software stacks enable us to take on technical challenges that have never been seen before, and deliver results that help our customers change the world.<br>
<br>
In Annapurna Labs we are at the forefront of hardware/software co-design not just in Amazon Web Services (AWS) but across the industry. Our Chassis Software team is looking for candidates interested in diving deep into the different hardware technologies that power our Machine Learning servers and develop the software and firmware to drive, support and sustain these technologies as they evolve though concept and manufacturing, and finally take their place in our rapidly expanding fleet of cutting edge Machine Learning products our customers demand.<br>
<br>
Key job responsibilities<br>

A day in the life<br>
The MLA Chassis Software team was formed to focus on board firmware primarily for mission-mode control of sensors and other board-level hardware. This includes debug, testing, qualification, and manufacturing. We touch technologies from device drivers to the I2C infrastructure pervasive in the server and everything in between. We are not working on machine learning algorithms, but rather we work on the physical systems (hardware) which execute and accelerate those machine learning algorithms. Data paths, I2C, and device control are our bread and butter. Some of us know what a Tensor is but really it's not what we do.<br>
<br>
About the team<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge-sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects that help our team members develop your engineering expertise so you feel empowered to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>

AWS Marketplace enables software sellers to reach all AWS customers; and enables software buyers to easily discover, purchase and consume software. Our goals include enriching the platform to support more diverse selection, improving buyer and seller experience and implementing new ideas to add new dimensions to the product. Our vision is to make AWS Marketplace one stop shop for buying and selling software just like Amazon.com is for retail.<br>
<br>
We are looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to help the team take AWS Marketplace to the next level. As a Software Development Engineer on the team you will own significant portions of the product and will have significant influence on our strategy by helping define the next wave of product features and system architecture. The systems are complex and there are huge opportunities to work at all levels from the front end user experience, to a set of robust platform services, to system level pieces and everything in between. You should be somebody who enjoys working on complex system software, is customer-centric, and is passionate about building quality software as well as achieving operational excellence.
<br>
<br>
The ideal candidate will have a demonstrable track record of success delivering new features or products. This person has thrived and succeeded in delivering high quality technology products/services in a hyper-growth environment where priorities shift fast. They have design and implementation experience, knowledge of web services and protocols, and an in-depth knowledge of distributed systems architectures. Experience with asynchronous workflow systems is a plus.<br>
<br>
Inclusive Team Culture:<br>
Here at AWS, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have ten employee-led affinity groups, reaching 40,000 employees in over 190 chapters globally. We have innovative benefit offerings, and we host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon&rsquo;s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.<br>
<br>
Work/Life Balance:<br>
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren&rsquo;t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don&rsquo;t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don&rsquo;t get paged for the same issue twice.<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth:<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>

At AWS AI our vision is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday developers and to democratize access to cutting edge infrastructure. In order to deliver on that vision, we&rsquo;ve created innovative software and hardware solutions that make it possible.<br>
