About Send</b></p>
<p>
In 2017, Send was founded by Andy Moss, Ben Huckel, and Matt McGrillis with a vision to reshape and enhance the underwriting process for commercial insurers-combining advanced technology with deep industry expertise.</p>
<p>
By 2019, we had delivered a commercial and specialty Underwriting Workbench for a leading global insurer-one of the UK's top five composite insurers and a major FTSE 100 carrier. This solution streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and enabled forward visibility.</p>
<p>
In 2022, we won three industry awards for the Underwriting Workbench and raised $10 million in Series A funding to support our expansion in the UK and US.</p>
<p>
The following year, in 2023, we launched Smart Submission, a stand-alone component of the Underwriting Workbench, and were named a <i>Leader</i> in the IDC MarketScape: Worldwide P&amp;C Intelligent Underwriting Workbench Applications Vendor Assessment.</p>
<p>
In 2024, we were recognised as a <i>Top Provider</i> in the Datos P&amp;C Workbench report and named a <i>Leader</i> in Celent's Underwriting Workbench reports for both North America and Global Markets.</p>
<p>
Our vision is to be the market-leading underwriting software platform for agile carriers.<br>
<b>#loveunderwriting</b></p><br>
<p></p>
<p><b>
Our Funding</b></p>
<p>
From 2017 to 2022, we bootstrapped our growth journey, building a profitable and stable company. In November 2022, following a year of strong customer and team growth, we secured $10 million in Series A funding to accelerate our expansion across the UK and US, as well as to further enhance our product development. We're proud to have the support and expertise of our investors, Mercia and Breega.</p>

<p>Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It&rsquo;s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.</p>
<p>
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.</p>
<p>
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We&rsquo;re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.</p>
<p>
Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.</p>
<p>
Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.</p>
<p>
When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.</p>
<p>
Work at Veeva. Work where it&rsquo;s best for you.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",Internet And Software,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Veeva-Systems,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/a8a3a7e550f20c66e05273685b25d47b,https://www.veeva.com/,"4280 Hacienda Drive Pleasanton, CA 94588 United States

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.</p>

<div>Syracuse University is a private, international research university with distinctive academics, diversely unique offerings, and an undeniable spirit. Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and over 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.<br>
<br>
The scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors, 100 minors, and 200 advanced degree programs offered across the University&rsquo;s 13 schools and colleges; over 15,000 undergraduates and over 6,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries. For more information, please visit http://www.syracuse.edu.</div>
</div><br>
<div><div><b>About the Syracuse area</b></div>
<div>Syracuse is a medium-sized city situated in the geographic center of New York State approximately 250 miles northwest of New York City. The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.</div>
</div><br>
<div><div><b>EEO Statement</b></div>
<div>Syracuse University is an equal-opportunity institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.</div>
</div><br>
<div><div><b>Commitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans</b></div>
<div>Syracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University&rsquo;s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.</div>
</div><br>
<div><div><b>Commitment to a Respectful and Welcoming Community</b></div>
<div>Syracuse University fosters a welcoming learning environment where students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all aspects of campus life reflect a broad range of perspectives and experiences. The University community values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to engage with and appreciate the richness of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences that shape our society. To achieve this, we strive to cultivate a community that respects and encourages open dialogue, understanding, and mutual respect.</div></div></div></div><div></div>",Education And Schools,https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Syracuse-University,https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/406fa4873c5930424aced6313eb901f4,https://www.syr.edu,"900 South Crouse Ave.

The candidate will conduct data mining and analysis exercises, maintain vital databases, create analytic reports, build program monitoring dashboards, and contribute to ongoing data analysis efforts to inform the Work Order Reform initiative. The position will be responsible for leading complex analyses, and will manage data collection and processing, statistical methods, and report preparation and presentation.

The Information Lab has a simple mission: to help people make sense of data. We believe that companies that use data well will have better futures than those that don&rsquo;t. We have helped clients such as The Vanguard Group, JPMorgan Chase, PwC, JLL, and Paramount Global do just that through specializing in and consulting on the leading products for data visualization and data integration - Tableau and Alteryx - since 2011.</div><div></div><div><br>
As a consultant in The Data School program, you will experience on-the-job training that is far more immersive and rewarding than traditional roles. The Data School offers a 28-month contract where we will pay you to learn about data and technology from some of the greatest data experts across the world (including six Tableau Visionaries and three Alteryx ACEs).<br>
</div><div></div><br>
<div>You&rsquo;ll undertake this intensive training over four months in our fantastic facility located on Union Square.

But there&rsquo;s more to our training than just technical skills.</div><div></div><div><br>
With support from your coaches and the wider team, you will learn broader skills about storing, managing, and presenting data as well as personal skills to help boost your own confidence in becoming an exceptional consultant. We teach these skills in an inclusive and collaborative environment where everyone is responsible for each other&rsquo;s development and success.</div><div></div><div><br>
Our training and consulting focus on two software programs, Tableau and Alteryx, which you can excel at without coding knowledge. Our consultants come from different walks of life and many had never heard of Tableau before they stumbled across us (you can meet some of them here). The one thing they do have in common is a passion for problem-solving, especially with data and evidence. If you share the same inquisitive nature and have a drive to uncover the truth with data, then The Data School could be the perfect next chapter in your career.</div><div></div><div><br>
Everyone is welcome at The Information Lab and The Data School, no matter what your background is, your educational history, what you look like, or what topics you like to analyze in your own time. Diversity is an asset that helps us discover more varied stories in both our client&rsquo;s data and the rest of the world&rsquo;s. It suggests solutions and improvements for intractable problems in new and unexpected places. Will your passion help us solve the next generation of data problems?<br>

Norm Ai, the leading Legal &amp; Compliance AI company, has a client base with a combined $30 trillion in assets under management. By turning legal code into AI code, Norm enables enterprises to move faster and more comprehensively in their legal and compliance processes with auditability, reliability, and trust.</p><p></p><p>
Norm&rsquo;s platform combines frontier AI, proprietary legal reasoning systems, and embedded legal and regulatory expertise.</p><p></p><p>
Norm Ai has raised more than $140 million, backed by Blackstone, Bain Capital, Vanguard, Citi, New York Life, TIAA, Coatue, Craft Ventures, Henry R. Kravis, and Marc Benioff.</p><p></p><p>
Norm Ai pioneered Legal Engineering, the process that empowers lawyers to build and supervise domain-specific AI agents with Norm&rsquo;s proprietary suite of no-code software tools. Norm hired dozens of lawyers from premier U.S. law firms and trained them as Legal Engineers, who specialize in breaking down legal workflows into units of analysis targeted enough to reliably leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning. The granular LLM outputs that constitute a given workflow are orchestrated in a logically structured and human interpretable manner and rigorously validated against data and expertise. The resulting dynamic systems can complete the first pass of the legal workflow and provide detailed explanations.</p><p></p><p>
We also developed the first Domain Specific Language (DSL) for fully representing regulatory requirements in AI code. This DSL, deployed with our enterprise platform, enables Norm clients to transform workflows and apply compliance checks at the source of business activities.</p><p></p><p>
