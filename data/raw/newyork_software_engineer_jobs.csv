<p>Are you a builder with deep expertise in Linux internals and Identity architecture? An elite technology-driven firm is seeking a Senior Systems Engineer to take ownership of its critical authentication platforms.

</p><br>
<p><b>Responsibilities:<br>
</b></p><br>
<p><b>Identity Architecture Modernization </b>&ndash; Redesign and modernize the firm&rsquo;s internal PKI and authentication services, bridging the gap between Kerberos/Active Directory and modern OIDC/OAuth standards.<br>

</p><br>
<p><b>Deep-dive Troubleshooting &ndash; </b>Go beyond standard admin tasks to debug complex OS, kernel, and filesystem issues using advanced diagnostic tools (strace, perf, eBPF).<br>

<br>
<p><b>What you&rsquo;ll need:<br>
</b></p><br>

</p></li><li><p>You possess the rare combination of deep Linux expertise AND architectural knowledge of Identity protocols (Kerberos, PKI, OIDC).
</p></li><li><p>Linux internals - you understand the OS at a deep level (Kernel, Systemd, Filesystems) and know how to harden it.
</p></li><li><p>You don't just use vendor tools; you write code (Python) to solve unique scalability and security challenges.
</p></li><li><p>You can effectively communicate complex architectural trade-offs to both software engineers and senior leadership.<br>
</p></li></ul><br>
<br>
<p><b>Why join them?<br>

<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.<br>
<br>
To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.</p>
<p>
#LongLiveDogs</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h2>
<p>
At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the best experience, every time.</p>
<p>
Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers (humans and their best friends) with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>
You'll support a group of talented engineers and managers across &quot;pawds&quot; who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to have a direct hand in scaling the business, solving novel customer problems, and building strong relationships along the way.</p>
<p>
If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you.</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Acquisition Marketers&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How You'll Make An Impact</b></h2>
<ul><li>Guide the strategic evolution of core systems, establishing clear boundaries, leading migrations, and enabling resilient architecture that scales and adapts to business needs</li>
<li>Influence product and business strategy through deep understanding of our system and products by identifying risks, constraints and opportunities</li>
<li>Foster alignment across the organization by building trust between &quot;pawds&quot;, refining priorities and ensuring the engineering strategy supports customer and company goals</li>
<li>Partner closely with Staff engineers and other engineering leaders to steer and shape the organization</li>

<li>Continuously raise the bar for engineering excellence by modeling high standards, mentoring senior engineers, and spreading best practices across the org</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>We're Excited About You Because</b></h2>
<ul><li>You bring 10+ years of experience in software engineering, with deep and varied expertise designing and evolving systems at scale</li>
<li>You have led architectural initiatives that reshaped systems and made them more reliable, maintainable, and extensible</li>
<li>You've partnered closely with product on business strategy and have helped organizations balance short and long term strategy</li>
<li>You are able to succeed in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, naturally curious and proactive self-starter, constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and solutions</li>
<li>You thrive at working across teams, aligning people and systems, and driving impact beyond your immediate scope</li>
<li>You mentor and elevate other senior engineers</li>
<li>You are committed to furthering the mission of The Farmer's Dog</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Office Guidelines</b></h2>
<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Belonging Philosophy:</b></h2>
<p>
At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.<br>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.<br>
<br>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.</p>
<p>
To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions,</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h2>
<p>
At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the right experience, every time.</p>
<p>
Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>
You'll join a group of talented engineers and managers who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to help scale the business, solve novel customer problems, and build strong relationships along the way.</p>
<p>
If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you.</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Acquisition Marketers&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How You'll Make an Impact</b></h2>
<ul><li>Lead the end-to-end lifecycle of complex systems and features, from planning through maintenance, ensuring long-term sustainability</li>
<li>Improve team execution by refining processes, tools, and practices that raise the bar for everyone</li>
<li>Collaborate with product managers, engineers, designers, and business stakeholders to shape strategy and achieve our goals</li>
<li>Contribute to our engineering culture and mentor the team through knowledge sharing, feedback, and design and incident reviews</li>
<li>Work our stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, OpenAPI, AWS), but embrace learning and applying new tools as needed</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>We're Excited About You Because</b></h2>
<ul><li>You lead by example and take full ownership over the success of the product, software and &quot;pawd&quot; (our name for cross-functional teams)</li>
<li>You are curious and regularly seek out ways to improve both our system and how we work</li>
<li>You lead projects with impact beyond just your pawd's domain and you bring others along</li>
<li>You elevate others through mentorship, code reviews and clear feedback</li>
<li>You welcome diverse opinions and actively seek input to challenge your assumptions</li>
<li>You see the value in communicating key decisions, tradeoffs and practices through writing</li>
<li>You are committed to furthering the mission of The Farmer's Dog</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Office Guidelines</b></h2>
<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>

We're building a small, diverse team of exceptional engineers who are excited about the future of agentic coding and care deeply about creating tools that make software development faster and more reliable.

About This Role:</b></h1><p>
You&rsquo;ll be working across the stack, including our Typescript+React frontend, Python/Go backend, and LLM infrastructure. You should have a good intuition for the right tools to use, and how to configure, combine, and tweak them to deliver the best results for our users.</p><p>
You bias towards action, and eagerly jump on things (or assign an agent) &ldquo;now&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;later&rdquo; or &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;. You say what you're going to do, and you do it (quickly).</p><p>
We work hybrid in-person in San Francisco (our office is in Mission Bay) and NYC, but are open to remote for strong candidates.</p><p>

Responsibilities:</b></h1><ul><li><p>
Talk directly to users: understand their requirements, build what they ask for, ask for their feedback, follow up as needed, and iterate based on what they say.</p></li><li><p>
Craft delightful product interactions.</p></li><li><p>
Proactively identify and implement improvements to our product and foundations (e.g. propose improvements to our core product; add database indices to better serve a feature; build internal tooling to manage the user experience around a feature).</p></li><li><p>
Other things that may come up from time to time to move our company forward (or keep the lights on).</p></li><li><p>
Collaborate closely with teammates and share learnings openly &mdash; we value thoughtful discussion as much as rapid iteration.</p></li><li><p>
Share and promote your work publicly (e.g. on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc).</p></li></ul><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Offer:</b></h1><ul><li><p>

Your choice of Macbook Pro + computer/office equipment stipend.</p></li><li><p>
Health, dental, and vision insurance.</p></li><li><p>
A relatively un-chaotic working environment (we aren't pivoting every week).</p></li><li><p>
An opportunity to lead and define our company.</p></li></ul><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Qualifications:</b></h1><ul><li><p>

Data science experience, especially around clustering and anomaly detection.</p></li><li><p>
Clear and thoughtful communication on technical and strategic topics: at this stage, you'll be helping build the foundations of our company. You should have ideas/opinions about almost everything we do, and you should be forthcoming with your thoughts (even if it means being disagreeable).</p></li><li><p>
Well-crafted, tastefully-design work examples.</p></li><li><p>
Bonus points:</p><ul><li><p>
Experience working on programming language tooling: compilers/parsers/indexers (e.g. LLVM, tree-sitter, SCIP) or type systems (e.g. Typescript itself or Sorbet).</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><b>
We encourage you to apply even if you don&rsquo;t meet every qualification listed.</b> We value potential, curiosity, and a willingness to learn as much as we value prior experience.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We&rsquo;re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.</p>

The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>

AWS Support also partners with a global list of customers that are building mission-critical applications on top of AWS services.<br>
<br>
Come join the AWS Marketplace Team in our mission to change the way enterprise software are bought and sold! AWS Marketplace enables software sellers to reach all AWS customers; and enables software buyers to easily discover, purchase and consume software. Our goals include enriching the platform to support more diverse selection, improving buyer and seller experience and implementing new ideas to add new dimensions to the product. Our vision is to make AWS Marketplace one stop shop for buying and selling software just like Amazon.com is for retail.<br>
<br>
We are looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to help the team take AWS Marketplace to the next level. As a Software Development Engineer on the team you will own significant portions of the product and will have significant influence on our strategy by helping define the next wave of product features and system architecture. The systems are complex and there are huge opportunities to work at all levels from the front end user experience, to a set of robust platform services, to system level pieces and everything in between. You should be somebody who enjoys working on complex system software, is customer-centric, and is passionate about building quality software as well as achieving operational excellence.
<br>
<br>
The ideal candidate will have a demonstrable track record of success delivering new features or products. This person has thrived and succeeded in delivering high quality technology products/services in a hyper-growth environment where priorities shift fast. They have design and implementation experience, knowledge of web services and protocols, and an in-depth knowledge of distributed systems architectures.

Amazon&rsquo;s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which remind team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.<br>
<br>
Work/Life Balance:<br>
Our team also puts a high value on work-life balance. Striking a healthy balance between your personal and professional life is crucial to your happiness and success here, which is why we aren&rsquo;t focused on how many hours you spend at work or online. Instead, we&rsquo;re happy to offer a flexible schedule so you can have a more productive and well-balanced life&mdash;both in and outside of work. This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don&rsquo;t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don&rsquo;t get paged for the same issue twice.<br>
<br>
Mentorship &amp; Career Growth:<br>
Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we&rsquo;re building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews. We care about your career growth and strive to assign projects based on what will help each team member develop into a better-rounded engineer and enable them to take on more complex tasks in the future.<br>
