The Database Solutions team within Apple Ads defines and implements database technologies, standards, and optimizations that ensure reliability, performance, and efficiency at scale. The team partners closely with Ads engineering and infrastructure groups to enable product delivery through design, configuration, and automation of a large fleet of cloud databases supporting Apple Ads applications.<br>
<br>
We are looking for a Cloud Database Engineer to help build and evolve the next generation of Apple Ads&rsquo; cloud database architecture - enabling fast, reliable, and scalable data operations across AWS-based environments supporting both transactional and analytical workloads.<br>
<br>
<b>Description</b><br>
<br>
In this role, you will design, provision, and automate database solutions across Aurora Postgres, Aurora MySQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB, and other distributed SQL or NoSQL platforms. You&rsquo;ll focus on enabling automation, observability, and optimization for the database services that power Apple Ads&rsquo; large-scale applications.<br>
<br>
The person in this role will:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Partner with engineering teams to understand data access patterns and recommend purpose-built cloud databases that best meet performance, reliability, and cost goals.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Build and enhance Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) modules for secure and automated provisioning, configuration, and compliance of database resources.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Develop Python or Go-based automation for deployment, monitoring, and self-healing operations.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Optimize and tune production database performance, troubleshoot complex issues, and improve resilience and observability.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Contribute to cloud migration and modernization initiatives, completing the transition from on-premises to AWS-managed databases.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Evaluate emerging database technologies (e.g., distributed SQL, NewSQL) and advocate for adoption where appropriate.</li></ul><br>
<ul><li>Participate in an on-call rotation for escalations (weekly, during U.S. business hours).</li></ul><br>
This is not a traditional DBA role. The ideal candidate combines a deep understanding of database internals with a cloud engineering and automation mindset - someone who designs solutions, not just maintains systems.<br>
<br>
<b>Preferred Qualifications</b><br>
<br>
Experience leading data modernization or cloud migration projects<br>
<br>
Knowledge of change data capture (CDC) frameworks such as GoldenGate, Debezium or AWS DMS<br>

<br>
Prior experience in Ad Tech or other high-scale distributed systems environments<br>
<br>
Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Computer Science or a related field; Master&rsquo;s degree preferred<br>
<br>
<b>Minimum Qualifications</b><br>
<br>
5+ years of experience engineering and operating cloud databases at scale (AWS preferred)<br>
<br>
Strong hands-on experience with Aurora Postgres/MySQL and database migration or modernization from on-prem to cloud<br>
<br>
Proven experience with Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) for database provisioning and policy compliance<br>
<br>
Scripting proficiency in Python (preferred) or Go, with working knowledge of Shell scripting<br>
<br>
Familiarity with NoSQL or distributed SQL databases (MongoDB, CockroachDB, DynamoDB, etc.)<br>

About Legion Health</b></h1><p>
Legion Health is on a mission to deliver the best psychiatric care in the world&mdash;and to do it at scale.</p><p>
We're building a <b>full-stack AI-native psychiatry network</b>&mdash;our clinicians provide high-quality care directly to patients, and AI agents automate all parts of our care operations (e.g., scheduling, risk analysis, billing, etc.). Our vision? A patient experience that&rsquo;s 10X better, more affordable, and higher-margin than ever before.</p><p>
Today, we're turning weeks-long wait times into same-day appointments, crafting seamless digital experiences in a broken healthcare system, and scaling a company that patients genuinely trust.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
The Opportunity</b></h1><p>
One of the <b>largest drivers of new patients is insurance&#8209;payer provider directories</b>. Accurate, telehealth&#8209;friendly listings translate directly into lives helped&mdash;and revenue realized. We need a detail&#8209;obsessed contractor to own these directories end&#8209;to&#8209;end.</p><p>
You will audit, correct, and continuously optimize Legion&rsquo;s listings across every payer&rsquo;s member portal and directory, then route patients who discover us there into our touchless, self&#8209;serve onboarding funnel. This role is perfect for a virtual assistant, data&#8209;entry specialist, or health&#8209;tech ops contractor who loves hunting down discrepancies, working with spreadsheets/APIs, and turning &ldquo;Call our office&rdquo; into a one&#8209;click digital experience.</p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Directory Audit &amp; Cleanup</b></h2><ul><li><p>
Build a master inventory of all Legion provider entries (NPIs, specialties, locations) across every contracted payer and network.</p></li><li><p>
Identify and fix errors: outdated addresses, missing telehealth flags, wrong specialties, inactive providers, duplicate listings, broken URLs.</p></li><li><p>
Standardize naming conventions, taxonomy codes, and &ldquo;Accepting New Patients&rdquo; indicators.</p></li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Prominence &amp; Search&#8209;Rank Boosting</b></h2><ul><li><p>
Partner with payer directory teams to surface Legion higher in search results (e.g., &ldquo;telepsychiatry,&rdquo; &ldquo;virtual psychiatry Texas&rdquo;).</p></li><li><p>
Ensure telehealth filter toggles, map pins, and specialty filters return Legion providers.</p></li><li><p>
Push for featured badges or &ldquo;virtual visit&rdquo; tags wherever available.</p></li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Data Sync &amp; Governance</b></h2><ul><li><p>
Establish a single &ldquo;source of truth&rdquo; spreadsheet or Airtable containing provider data, directory status, update dates, and payer contacts.</p></li><li><p>
Set up monthly sweeps (manual or scripted) to confirm listings remain accurate after payer updates.</p></li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Automate whenever possible</b>&mdash;simple scripts, Airtable automations, PostHog funnels&mdash;whatever keeps manual work near zero.</p></li><li><p><b>
Own outcomes</b>&mdash;you measure success in booked appointments, not completed forms.</p></li></ul><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
