About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>
Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office</p></li><li><p>
Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we&rsquo;ll take care of the costs</p></li><li><p>
Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision.</p></li><li><p>
Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar.</p></li><li><p>
Parental Leave: Work with us to build a leave schedule that works for you and your family</p></li></ul><p></p><p>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>
Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office</p></li><li><p>
Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we&rsquo;ll take care of the costs</p></li><li><p>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p></p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p></p><p><b>
Reducto</b><b> breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content.</b> This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>

Initially built to take the pain out of peer-to-peer payments, Cash App has gone from a simple product with a single purpose to a dynamic ecosystem, developing unique financial products, including Afterpay/Clearpay, to provide a better way to send, spend, invest, borrow and save to our 50+ million monthly active customers. We want to redefine the world's relationship with money to make it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible.</p>
<p>
Today, Cash App has thousands of employees working globally across office and remote locations, with a culture geared toward innovation, collaboration and impact. We've been a distributed team since day one, and many of our roles can be done remotely from the countries where Cash App operates. No matter the location, we tailor our experience to ensure our employees are creative, productive, and happy.</p>
<p><b>
The Role</b></p>
<p>
We're the Access team, and we're building the next generation of authentication and permissions infrastructure for Block. Behind every login and every account there's a platform that needs to be both rock-solid and remarkably flexible.</p>
<p>
This isn't about maintaining legacy systems, it's about building the foundation that will enable Cash App and Block's ecosystem to scale while serving increasingly diverse customer needs.</p>
<p><b>
The Challenge:</b> As Block accelerates product innovation, we're seeing an explosion of new use cases: different account capabilities, different authentication requirements, different customer cohorts with different needs. We're building a platform that lets product teams move fast while we maintain the trust and security that our customers depend on.</p>
<p><b>
The Opportunity:</b> You'll be joining at an inflection point. The decisions we make now about architecture, about APIs, about how we enable other teams&mdash;will define how Block scales for years to come. This is foundational work with massive leverage.</p>
<p><b>
You Will</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Design and build the APIs and services that power <b>Authentication &amp; Permissions</b> across Cash App and Block's ecosystem, the systems that determine who can access what, and how they prove they are who they say they are. The work is varied and impactful. You might:
<ul><li><b>Build fine-grained permissions systems </b>that enable different roles and capabilities across various account configurations</li>
<li><b>Build secure authentication experiences</b> that protect customers while maintaining seamless access to their accounts</li>
<li><b>Improve account recovery</b> success rates, helping legitimate customers regain access while keeping bad actors out</li>
<li><b>Consolidate authentication platforms</b>, migrating critical flows into scalable, composable services</li>
<li><b>Design authorization primitives</b> that product teams across Block can use to build secure, flexible experiences</li>
</ul></li><li><b>How you'll work:</b> You'll navigate complexity with pragmatism. You'll balance immediate business needs with long-term platform goals. You'll ship iteratively while keeping the big picture in mind. You'll collaborate across product, design, security, and engineering teams. You'll think critically about priorities. You'll adapt and thrive in an environment where priorities shift and requirements evolve.The common thread: you'll be solving complex technical problems that directly impact both customer trust and product velocity.

The Advertiser Guidance team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns.

<br>
Diverse Experiences<br>
AWS values diverse experiences. Even if you do not meet all of the qualifications and skills listed in the job description, we encourage candidates to apply.

Key job responsibilities<br>
Responsibilities include some combination of the following:<br>
<br>
<ul><li>Profile and optimize the performance of the database API and infrastructure to enable faster experiments and analysis routines.</li><li>Propose and implement horizontal scaling strategies to enable high, multi-region availability of experimental data and scaling to larger quantum devices.</li><li>Leverage infrastructure-as-code to continuously deploy improvements to our data &amp; automation platforms.</li><li>Lower the barrier to entry for software development by automating schema migrations and enabling seamless setup of dev environments.</li><li>Maintain Amazon&rsquo;s high security bar without slowing down the pace of internal development.</li><li>Upgrade and maintain the cloud infrastructure that underpins the web services offered by our team.</li><li>Implement best practices for observability and monitoring to enable rapid debugging and high service uptime.</li><li>Empower others to actively contribute to the codebase through mentorship and documentation.</li></ul><br>
We are looking for candidates with strong engineering principles, a bias for action, superior problem-solving, and excellent communication skills. Working effectively within a team environment is essential. As a software engineer embedded in a research organization, you will have the opportunity to work on new ideas and stay abreast of the field of experimental quantum computation.<br>
<br>
A day in the life<br>
