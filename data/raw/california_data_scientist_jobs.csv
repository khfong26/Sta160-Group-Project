Jerry is looking for a <b>Data scientist</b> to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years &mdash; scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company&rsquo;s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science &amp; analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.</p><p></p><p>
Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible &ndash; insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc &ndash; a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we&rsquo;ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot &amp; voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.</p><p></p><p><b>
Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>
Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</div></li><li><div>
Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</div></li><li><div>
Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Preferred experience:</b></p><ul><li><div>

1+ years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis</div></li><li><div>
High level of comfort with SQL or Python</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>

We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance.

This role is an <b><i>in-house mathematician</i></b> role.

The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.</p><p></p><p><br>
Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.</p><p></p><p><br>

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn&rsquo;t work together.<br>
<br>
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We&rsquo;re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.</p>

Our systems operate at <b>exabyte scale</b>, processing <b>petabytes of data each day</b> for some of the world&rsquo;s most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently.</p><p>
We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from <b>more efficient data systems</b>. By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive.</p><p>
Our long-term vision is <b><i>Efficient Intelligence</i></b>: AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the <b>Foundational Data Systems</b> that make structured AI possible.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Motionworks is a leader in population intelligence&mdash;providing past, present, and predictive insights on how the total population moves throughout the physical world. We transform billions of GPS traces, POI databases, and behavioral signals into actionable insights for retailers, advertisers, urban planners, and transportation agencies across North America.</p>
<p>
Our Population Intelligence Platform tackles one of the hardest problems in data science: inferring population-level behavior from sparse, noisy, messy location data. We don't have the luxury of clean datasets&mdash;we work with terabytes of real-world GPS traces where some data is good, some is not, and the signal often hides in the noise.</p>
<p>
Job Summary</p>
<p>
We're hiring a Senior Data Scientist to lead methodology development for our core population modeling systems. This is not a data engineering role&mdash;we have engineers who productionize your work. This is an applied research and modeling role where you'll design, defend, and validate statistical models that turn observed travel behavior from millions of devices into robust population-level insights. At the end of the day, we need results, not just research. Your work will directly shape how we measure foot traffic, predict travel patterns, and distinguish meaningful signals from noise at national and international scale.</p>
<p>
You will be tasked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing and validating Bayesian inference models to extrapolate observed location data to unobserved populations</li>
<li>Developing methods to distinguish personal travel from commercial delivery patterns in ambiguous GPS traces</li>
<li>Building statistical frameworks for handling varying data quality and penetration rates across geographies</li>
<li>Creating defensible models for trip purpose inference, stay-point detection, and behavioral segmentation</li>
<li>Writing concise technical documentation to explain methodology to internal stakeholders and clients</li>
<li>Prototyping approaches that engineering teams can translate into production pipelines (Python, SQL, or other cloud-native tools)</li>
<li>Recommending new data acquisitions and validation techniques to improve model performance</li>
</ul>
<p></p><p>Required Qualifications and Skills</p>
<ul>
<li><b>8-10 years of applied experience</b> working with large-scale location, mobility, or behavioral data (OR Master's/PhD + demonstrated applied work in transportation/retail analytics)</li>
<li><b>Proven experience at scale</b> with messy, real-world datasets&mdash;hundreds of millions of records, imperfect data quality, sparse observations</li>
<li><b>Deep statistical foundations</b>: Can derive likelihood functions, explain model assumptions, defend methodological choices with mathematical rigor</li>
<li><b>Bayesian inference </b>expertise: Experience with hierarchical models, prior specification, and uncertainty quantification&mdash;critical for extrapolating from sparse observations to population-level insights and handling varying data quality across geographies</li>
<li><b>Strong technical skills</b>: Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, PyMC or similar) and SQL for complex queries and data exploration in BigQuery/Spark environments</li>
<li><b>Domain intuition</b>: Understanding of how people move through cities&mdash;even if you discover patterns empirically, you should recognize when results align with or contradict transportation theory
</li></ul><p></p><p>Ideal Background</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience at a technology company working on mobility/logistics problems at global scale</li>
<li>Familiarity with travel behavior concepts (trip chaining, mode choice, origin-destination modeling)</li>
<li>GIS/geospatial analysis skills (PostGIS, H3, spatial joins)</li>

We're using advanced approaches such as foundation models to connect information about our videos and customers from a variety of information sources, acquiring and processing data sets on a scale that only a few companies in the world can match. This will enable us to recommend titles effectively, even when we don't have a large behavioral signal (to tackle the cold-start title problem). It will also allow us to find our customer's niche interests, helping them discover groups of titles that they didn't even know existed. We are looking for creative &amp; customer obsessed machine learning scientists who can apply the latest research, state of the art algorithms and ML to build highly scalable page personalization solutions. You'll be a research leader in the space and a hands-on ML practitioner, guiding and collaborating with talented teams of engineers and scientists and senior leaders in the Prime Video organization. You will also have the opportunity to publish your research at internal and external conferences.

Just Walk Out (JWO) is a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout&mdash;you just grab and go! Customers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take what they want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals and grocery essentials, and go!<br>
<br>
Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out Technology, which automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you&rsquo;re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we&rsquo;ll charge your account and send you a receipt. Check it out at amazon.com/go. Designed and custom-built by Amazonians, our Just Walk Out Technology uses a variety of technologies including computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA! Our goal is to be Earths&rsquo; most customer centric company and we are just getting started. We need people who want to join an ambitious program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.<br>
<br>
Key job responsibilities<br>
Everyone on the team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that&rsquo;s more startup than big company. We&rsquo;ll need to tackle problems that span a variety of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, real-time and distributed systems.
<br>
<br>
As an Applied Scientist, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other scientists. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and given the size of this initiative, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon in different locations. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that&rsquo;s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that, frankly, haven&rsquo;t been solved at scale before - anywhere. Along the way, we guarantee that you&rsquo;ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.<br>
<br>
A key focus of this role will be developing and implementing advanced visual reasoning systems that can understand complex spatial relationships and object interactions in real-time. You'll work on designing autonomous AI agents that can make intelligent decisions based on visual inputs, understand customer behavior patterns, and adapt to dynamic retail environments. This includes developing systems that can perform complex scene understanding, reason about object permanence, and predict customer intentions through visual cues.<br>
