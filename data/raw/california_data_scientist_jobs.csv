Trusted by 4,000+ of the world's most popular apps&mdash;including industry leaders like Match Group, Rakuten, Yahoo, and Coupang&mdash;Sendbird powers over 7 billion messages every month.</p>
<p>
We're looking for an AI Agent Engineer to help transform how our company operates, not by adding more people, but by multiplying the capability &amp; throughput of every person who's here.</p>
<p>
Your mandate is simple but audacious: build, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents that 100&times; our internal productivity. You'll sit at the nerve center of the company, working directly with the CEO and Chief of Staff, to identify, design, and launch autonomous systems that replace repetitive, and potentially complex workflows, augment decision-making with holistic data, and amplify execution velocity across every team and individuals.</p>
<p>
And you won't be handed tasks, you'll go hunting for them based on the priorities discussed and set with the CEO and the executive team.
</p><p><i>This role requires an onsite schedule 5 days/week in our San Mateo, CA office.
</i></p><p><b>What You Will Do</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Architect, build, and deploy internal AI agents that can reason over unstructured data (Slack, google docs, google sheets, email, cloud &amp; AI infrastructures, data warehouse, dashboards, CRMs, ERP, finance, accounting, etc.) and act autonomously &mdash; e.g., automating tasks, scheduling follow-ups, generating insights, or coordinating actions across systems.</li>
<li>Identify and map inefficiencies across functions (e.g., Revenue Ops, People Ops, Finance &amp; Accounting, Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and even Product Development) and build agentic automations that compress time and cognitive load, and boost productivity, if not automate completely.</li>
<li>Prototype and ship fast &mdash; from prompt graphs to fine-tuned models, toolchains, and LLM orchestration frameworks (LangChain, OpenDevin, etc.).</li>
<li>Collaborate across boundaries: work with every department to re-imagine workflows through AI-first mindset and leverage, not incremental efficiency.</li>
<li>Instrument productivity metrics &mdash; measure and visualize the before/after impact of agent deployment on velocity, decision quality, and throughput.</li>
<li>Teach and evangelize the adoption of AI and agents across the organization to enable as many employees as possible to become 100x employees.</li>
<li>Stay at the frontier of emerging LLMs, retrieval frameworks, and agentic architectures, bringing the latest techniques directly into production.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why This Role Matters</b></p>
<p>
This is not an R&amp;D lab project &mdash; this is the AI nerve center of the company. You'll work shoulder-to-shoulder with the CEO and Chief of Staff to redefine how a high-velocity organization operates in an AI-default world. The agents you design, build, and deploy will literally become part of our workforce &mdash; compounding productivity across every function.</p>
<p><b>
Who You Are</b></p>
<ul>
<li>You're an engineer who builds and iterates fast, and thinks systemically &mdash; capable of connecting APIs, data streams, and workflows into cohesive autonomous systems.</li>
<li>Fluent in modern AI stacks (Python, TypeScript, LLM APIs, LangChain, vector databases, retrieval pipelines).</li>
<li>Deep empathy for how organizations and businesses actually operate &mdash; you can sit in a finance meeting or customer success review and instantly spot what should or could be automated.</li>
<li>Obsessed with velocity, leverage, and compounding productivity. You believe an AI agent should not just do human work faster &mdash; it should do what humans never had time to imagine.</li>
<li>You're as comfortable in the command line as you are in the boardroom.</li>
<li>You're strongly aligned to our 7 core values</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Bonus Superpowers</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with multi-agent orchestration or workflow engines.</li>
<li>Background in data engineering or MLOps for LLM applications.</li>
<li>A track record of &quot;automation art&quot; &mdash; professional or passion projects where your systems replaced hours of cognitive work with seconds of autonomous reasoning.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our US benefits include (but are not limited to)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>20 days PTO, 13 paid US company holidays, 7 sick days, 1 volunteer day, plus 2 rest/rejuvenation days and birthday day off</li>

<li><i>Be Your Best Self:</i> An annual stipend of $3,500 (prorated by start date) for expenses ranging from professional development classes and training, to personality assessments, gym memberships, books, fitness classes, mental health services and massages</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pay Transparency</b></p>
<p>

To determine our ranges, we utilize a variety of compensation data benchmarked against similar-stage growth companies.

<br><br>
In this role, you’ll own the AI and engineering strategy and execution behind Foundry models that power everything from franchise extensions and new IP development to modern GenAI workflows at production scale. You’ll partner closely with studio, product, and infrastructure teams to turn ambitious creative visions into reliable, high-performance ML systems that transform how content is conceived, produced, and delivered.
<br><br>
What you will do
<br><br>
Own the end-to-end ML strategy for our Foundry engineering and science across Generative Media models, from applied research to production deployment.
<br><br>
Lead and grow a high-performing team of applied scientists and ML engineers; set clear goals, coach senior talent, and create a culture of experimentation, rigor, and delivery.
<br><br>
<b>Design and evolve our multi-tier model stack:</b> foundation models, franchise models, on-set integration, and social/short-form extensions, and workflows.
<br><br>
Partner closely with studio, production, and product teams to translate creative and business requirements into concrete ML roadmaps, milestones, and success metrics.
<br><br>
Drive the technical architecture for training and inference at scale: data pipelines, evaluation frameworks, model lifecycle, and GPU/accelerator utilization across a multi-year horizon.
<br><br>
Establish and own quality bars for generative output (visual fidelity, temporal consistency, editability, safety) and build the evaluation tools, benchmarks, and human-in-the-loop processes to enforce them.
<br><br>
Collaborate with infrastructure and platform teams to design scalable, cost-efficient serving for real-time on-set use cases and high-volume social content generation.
<br><br>
Stay on top of the GenAI research ecosystem and selectively bring in new techniques (e.g., diffusion, video transformers, latent video models, control/adapters) when they materially improve capability, cost, or speed.
<br>What you need to succeed
<br><br>
10+ years of experience in applied machine learning, including 4+ years leading senior ML/engineering teams building real products at scale.
<br><br>
Deep hands-on expertise with modern generative models (diffusion, transformers, VAEs, latent video models, or similar) and experience taking at least one such system into production.
<br><br>
<b>Strong background in large-scale training and inference:</b> distributed training, GPU/accelerator stacks (e.g., CUDA, NCCL), model optimization/quantization, and performance debugging.
<br><br>
<b>Proven ability to design and ship ML systems end-to-end:</b> data pipelines, training, eval, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
<br><br>
Experience working with high-resolution media (4K+ video, high bit-depth pipelines) or adjacent domains where bandwidth and latency constraints matter.
<br><br>
Excellent leadership and communication skills; able to work directly with creative, production, and business stakeholders and turn ambiguous problems into clear technical plans.
<br><br>
Strong software engineering fundamentals (Python, modern ML frameworks such as PyTorch/JAX, production code quality, CI/CD, observability).
<br><br>
Bachelor’s/Master’s/PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience building and leading advanced ML systems.

Jerry is looking for a <b>Data scientist</b> to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years &mdash; scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company&rsquo;s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science &amp; analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.</p><p></p><p>
Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible &ndash; insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc &ndash; a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we&rsquo;ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot &amp; voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.</p><p></p><p><b>
Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:</b></p><p><i>
&quot;The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say &quot;key,&quot; I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).</i></p><p></p><p><i>
The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.</i></p><p></p><p><i>
I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.&quot;</i></p><p></p><p><b>
How you will make an impact:</b></p><ul><li><div>
Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</div></li><li><div>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p></p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p></p><p><b>
Reducto</b><b> breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content.</b> This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>
Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office</p></li><li><p>
Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we&rsquo;ll take care of the costs</p></li><li><p>
Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision.</p></li><li><p>
Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar.</p></li><li><p>

<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

We're using advanced approaches such as foundation models to connect information about our videos and customers from a variety of information sources, acquiring and processing data sets on a scale that only a few companies in the world can match. This will enable us to recommend titles effectively, even when we don't have a large behavioral signal (to tackle the cold-start title problem). It will also allow us to find our customer's niche interests, helping them discover groups of titles that they didn't even know existed. We are looking for creative &amp; customer obsessed machine learning scientists who can apply the latest research, state of the art algorithms and ML to build highly scalable page personalization solutions. You'll be a research leader in the space and a hands-on ML practitioner, guiding and collaborating with talented teams of engineers and scientists and senior leaders in the Prime Video organization. You will also have the opportunity to publish your research at internal and external conferences.

The Annapurna Labs team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) builds AWS Neuron, the software development kit used to accelerate deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon&rsquo;s custom machine learning accelerators, Inferentia and Trainium.<br>
<br>
The AWS Neuron SDK, developed by the Annapurna Labs team at AWS, is the backbone for accelerating deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon's Inferentia and Trainium ML accelerators. This comprehensive toolkit includes an ML compiler, runtime, and application framework that seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and JAX enabling unparalleled ML inference and training performance.<br>
<br>
The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team is at the forefront of running a wide range of models and supporting novel architecture alongside maximizing their performance for AWS's custom ML accelerators. Working across the stack from PyTorch till the hardware-software boundary, our engineers build systematic infrastructure, innovate new methods and create high-performance kernels for ML functions, ensuring every compute unit is fine tuned for optimal performance for our customers' demanding workloads. We combine deep hardware knowledge with ML expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI acceleration.<br>
<br>
As part of the broader Neuron organization, our team works across multiple technology layers - from frameworks and kernels and collaborate with compiler to runtime and collectives. We not only optimize current performance but also contribute to future architecture designs, working closely with customers to enable their models and ensure optimal performance. This role offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and distributed architectures, where you'll help shape the future of AI acceleration technology<br>
<br>
You will architect and implement business critical features, and mentor a brilliant team of experienced engineers. We operate in spaces that are very large, yet our teams remain small and agile. There is no blueprint. We're inventing. We're experimenting. It is a very unique learning culture. The team works closely with customers on their model enablement, providing direct support and optimization expertise to ensure their machine learning workloads achieve optimal performance on AWS ML accelerators. The team collaborates with open source ecosystems to provide seamless integration and bring peak performance at scale for customers and developers.<br>
<br>
This role is responsible for development, enablement and performance tuning of a wide variety of LLM model families, including massive scale large language models like the Llama family, DeepSeek and beyond. The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team works side by side with compiler engineers and runtime engineers to create, build and tune distributed inference solutions with Trainium and Inferentia. Experience optimizing inference performance for both latency and throughput on such large models across the stack from system level optimizations through to Pytorch or JAX is a must have.<br>

As part of the AWS Solutions organization, we have a vision to provide business applications, leveraging Amazon&rsquo;s unique experience and expertise, that are used by millions of companies worldwide to manage day-to-day operations. We will accomplish this by accelerating our customers&rsquo; businesses through delivery of intuitive and differentiated technology solutions that solve enduring business challenges.

The Team<br>
<br>
Just Walk Out (JWO) is a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout&mdash;you just grab and go! Customers simply use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take what they want from our selection of fresh, delicious meals and grocery essentials, and go!<br>
<br>
Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by our Just Walk Out Technology, which automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you&rsquo;re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we&rsquo;ll charge your account and send you a receipt. Check it out at amazon.com/go. Designed and custom-built by Amazonians, our Just Walk Out Technology uses a variety of technologies including computer vision, sensor fusion, and advanced machine learning. Innovation is part of our DNA! Our goal is to be Earths&rsquo; most customer centric company and we are just getting started. We need people who want to join an ambitious program that continues to push the state of the art in computer vision, machine learning, distributed systems and hardware design.<br>
<br>
Key job responsibilities<br>
Everyone on the team needs to be entrepreneurial, wear many hats and work in a highly collaborative environment that&rsquo;s more startup than big company. We&rsquo;ll need to tackle problems that span a variety of domains: computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, real-time and distributed systems.
<br>
<br>
As an Applied Scientist, you will help solve a variety of technical challenges and mentor other scientists. You will tackle challenging, novel situations every day and given the size of this initiative, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to work with multiple technical teams at Amazon in different locations. You should be comfortable with a degree of ambiguity that&rsquo;s higher than most projects and relish the idea of solving problems that, frankly, haven&rsquo;t been solved at scale before - anywhere. Along the way, we guarantee that you&rsquo;ll learn a ton, have fun and make a positive impact on millions of people.<br>
<br>
A key focus of this role will be developing and implementing advanced visual reasoning systems that can understand complex spatial relationships and object interactions in real-time. You'll work on designing autonomous AI agents that can make intelligent decisions based on visual inputs, understand customer behavior patterns, and adapt to dynamic retail environments. This includes developing systems that can perform complex scene understanding, reason about object permanence, and predict customer intentions through visual cues.<br>
