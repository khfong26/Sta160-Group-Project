So what are we looking for in new team members? Well, we hire for &ldquo;GRIT&rdquo;. The textbook definition of GRIT is demonstrating the intersection of passion and perseverance towards long term goals. At Scribd, we are inspired by the potential that this can unlock, and ask each of our employees to pursue a GRIT-ty approach to their work. In a tactical sense, GRIT is also a handy acronym that outlines the standards we hold ourselves and each other to. Here&rsquo;s what that means for you: we&rsquo;re looking for someone who showcases the ability to set and achieve <b>G</b>oals, achieve <b>R</b>esults within their job responsibilities, contribute <b>I</b>nnovative ideas and solutions, and positively influence the broader <b>T</b>eam through collaboration and attitude.</p><p></p><p><b>
About the team and role</b></p><p>
We are building a new Discovery product organization at Scribd.com, and this role is the founding Director of Product for that group. You will lead the strategy and execution across our recommendations, search, ranking, and discovery experiences.</p><p>
Our corpus spans hundreds of millions of documents, and our goal is not just to help people find files, but to help hundreds of millions of applied learners discover the knowledge inside those documents.

Our Story</b></h1><p>
Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. While together at Google, they were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn&rsquo;t used for enterprise products and services inside the company.The quality just wasn&rsquo;t there. So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.</p><p></p><p>
LILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn&rsquo;t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, human-in-the-loop systems, and now agentic AI.</p><p></p><p>

Our Story</b></h1><p>
Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. While together at Google, they were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn&rsquo;t used for enterprise products and services inside the company.The quality just wasn&rsquo;t there. So they set out to build something better. LILT was born.</p><p></p><p>
LILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn&rsquo;t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, human-in-the-loop systems, and now agentic AI.</p><p></p><p>
With AI innovation accelerating and enterprise demand growing, the next phase of LILT&rsquo;s journey is just beginning.</p><p></p><h1 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

About Reducto</b></h2><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p></p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p></p><p><b>
Reducto</b><b> breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content.</b> This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>

Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>

<b>Strong background in large-scale training and inference:</b> distributed training, GPU/accelerator stacks (e.g., CUDA, NCCL), model optimization/quantization, and performance debugging.
<br><br>
<b>Proven ability to design and ship ML systems end-to-end:</b> data pipelines, training, eval, deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
<br><br>
Experience working with high-resolution media (4K+ video, high bit-depth pipelines) or adjacent domains where bandwidth and latency constraints matter.
<br><br>
Excellent leadership and communication skills; able to work directly with creative, production, and business stakeholders and turn ambiguous problems into clear technical plans.
<br><br>

Here&rsquo;s what they said.</b></div><p></p><p>
At most companies, engineers wait.</p><p>
Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.</p><p></p><p>
At Jerry.ai, we don&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>
If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: <b><i>&ldquo;At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you&rsquo;ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. <b><i>&ldquo;Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,&rdquo; </i></b>said another. <b><i>&ldquo;And things move fast.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We don&rsquo;t do bureaucracy. We don&rsquo;t do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. <b><i>&ldquo;The leaders here lead by example,&rdquo;</i></b> one teammate shared. <b><i>&ldquo;They have very high standards. They don&rsquo;t settle for just OK.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
It&rsquo;s challenging work, but it&rsquo;s meaningful. You&rsquo;ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You&rsquo;ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: <b><i>&ldquo;I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We&rsquo;re a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.</p><p></p><p><b>
So, what is </b><b>Jerry.ai</b><b> and why should you care?  </b></p><p>
Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you&rsquo;ll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage.

From insurance to repairs to safety, we&rsquo;re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home.

Here&rsquo;s what they said.</b></div><p></p><p>
At most companies, engineers wait.</p><p>
Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.</p><p></p><p>
At Jerry.ai, we don&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>
If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: <b><i>&ldquo;At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you&rsquo;ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. <b><i>&ldquo;Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,&rdquo; </i></b>said another. <b><i>&ldquo;And things move fast.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We don&rsquo;t do bureaucracy. We don&rsquo;t do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. <b><i>&ldquo;The leaders here lead by example,&rdquo;</i></b> one teammate shared. <b><i>&ldquo;They have very high standards. They don&rsquo;t settle for just OK.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
It&rsquo;s challenging work, but it&rsquo;s meaningful. You&rsquo;ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You&rsquo;ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: <b><i>&ldquo;I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We&rsquo;re a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.</p><p></p><p><b>
So, what is </b><b>Jerry.ai</b><b> and why should you care?  </b></p><p>
Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you&rsquo;ll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we&rsquo;re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we&rsquo;re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion+ problem and we&rsquo;re the only company tackling it end-to-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we&rsquo;re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M 50M users next.</p><p></p><p><b>

Here&rsquo;s what they said.</b></div><p></p><p>
At most companies, engineers wait.</p><p>
Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved.</p><p></p><p>
At Jerry.ai, we don&rsquo;t wait.</p><p>
If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: <b><i>&ldquo;At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you&rsquo;ll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. <b><i>&ldquo;Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,&rdquo; </i></b>said another. <b><i>&ldquo;And things move fast.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We don&rsquo;t do bureaucracy. We don&rsquo;t do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. <b><i>&ldquo;The leaders here lead by example,&rdquo;</i></b> one teammate shared. <b><i>&ldquo;They have very high standards. They don&rsquo;t settle for just OK.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
It&rsquo;s challenging work, but it&rsquo;s meaningful. You&rsquo;ll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You&rsquo;ll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: <b><i>&ldquo;I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time.&rdquo;</i></b></p><p></p><p>
We&rsquo;re a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind.</p><p></p><p><b>
So, what is </b><b>Jerry.ai</b><b> and why should you care?  </b></p><p>
Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you&rsquo;ll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we&rsquo;re building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we&rsquo;re reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion+ problem and we&rsquo;re the only company tackling it end-to-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we&rsquo;re profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M 50M users next.</p><p></p><p><b>
What you&rsquo;ll work on:</b></p><ul><li><div><b>
Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks</b> end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage.
</div></li><li><div>Fast sprint cycles: <b>ship new automations in 1&ndash;2 weeks </b>on average.</div></li><li><div>
Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules.</div></li><li><div><b>
Design backend pipelines that </b>sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and <b>power seamless re-shopping experiences</b>.</div></li><li><div>
Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero.</div></li><li><div>
Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and <b>improve customer retention</b>.</div></li><li><div>
Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack.</div></li><li><div>
Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture.</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Our tech stack:</b></p><ul><li><div><b>
Frontend &amp; backend:</b> TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo</div></li><li><div><b>
API: </b>GraphQL</div></li><li><div><b>
Data: </b>Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis</div></li><li><div><b>
Infrastructure: </b>AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda</div></li><li><div>
Our business has grown more complex over time.<b> We&rsquo;re refactoring major parts of our code base </b>&mdash; simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform&rsquo;s growth. You&rsquo;ll help build the foundation for that next phase.</div></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What we&rsquo;re looking for:</b></p><ul><li><div><b>
Experience: </b>At least 5 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software</div></li><li><div><b>
Technical strength: </b>Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack.</div></li><li><div><b>
Problem solver: </b>You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly.</div></li><li><div><b>
Ownership: </b>You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build.</div></li><li><div><b>
Collaboration:</b> Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.</div></li><li><div><b>
Curiosity + adaptability:</b> You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.</div></li></ul><p></p><p>
This isn&rsquo;t another coding job. <b>You&rsquo;ll work in a flexible</b>, fast-moving, and <b>highly</b> <b>collaborative</b> <b>culture</b>, where <b>innovation</b> <b>is</b> <b>encouraged</b>,<b> your voice is heard</b>, and the <b>impact of your work is immediate</b>.

This will enable us to recommend titles effectively, even when we don't have a large behavioral signal (to tackle the cold-start title problem). It will also allow us to find our customer's niche interests, helping them discover groups of titles that they didn't even know existed. We are looking for creative &amp; customer obsessed machine learning scientists who can apply the latest research, state of the art algorithms and ML to build highly scalable page personalization solutions. You'll be a research leader in the space and a hands-on ML practitioner, guiding and collaborating with talented teams of engineers and scientists and senior leaders in the Prime Video organization. You will also have the opportunity to publish your research at internal and external conferences.

The Annapurna Labs team at Amazon Web Services (AWS) builds AWS Neuron, the software development kit used to accelerate deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon&rsquo;s custom machine learning accelerators, Inferentia and Trainium.<br>
<br>
The AWS Neuron SDK, developed by the Annapurna Labs team at AWS, is the backbone for accelerating deep learning and GenAI workloads on Amazon's Inferentia and Trainium ML accelerators. This comprehensive toolkit includes an ML compiler, runtime, and application framework that seamlessly integrates with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and JAX enabling unparalleled ML inference and training performance.<br>
<br>
The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team is at the forefront of running a wide range of models and supporting novel architecture alongside maximizing their performance for AWS's custom ML accelerators. Working across the stack from PyTorch till the hardware-software boundary, our engineers build systematic infrastructure, innovate new methods and create high-performance kernels for ML functions, ensuring every compute unit is fine tuned for optimal performance for our customers' demanding workloads. We combine deep hardware knowledge with ML expertise to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI acceleration.<br>
<br>
As part of the broader Neuron organization, our team works across multiple technology layers - from frameworks and kernels and collaborate with compiler to runtime and collectives. We not only optimize current performance but also contribute to future architecture designs, working closely with customers to enable their models and ensure optimal performance. This role offers a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and distributed architectures, where you'll help shape the future of AI acceleration technology<br>
<br>
You will architect and implement business critical features, and mentor a brilliant team of experienced engineers. We operate in spaces that are very large, yet our teams remain small and agile. There is no blueprint. We're inventing. We're experimenting. It is a very unique learning culture. The team works closely with customers on their model enablement, providing direct support and optimization expertise to ensure their machine learning workloads achieve optimal performance on AWS ML accelerators. The team collaborates with open source ecosystems to provide seamless integration and bring peak performance at scale for customers and developers.<br>
<br>
This role is responsible for development, enablement and performance tuning of a wide variety of LLM model families, including massive scale large language models like the Llama family, DeepSeek and beyond. The Inference Enablement and Acceleration team works side by side with compiler engineers and runtime engineers to create, build and tune distributed inference solutions with Trainium and Inferentia. Experience optimizing inference performance for both latency and throughput on such large models across the stack from system level optimizations through to Pytorch or JAX is a must have.<br>
