About Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs</i></p><p>
PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that&rsquo;s simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn&rsquo;t an inconvenience&mdash;it&rsquo;s a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week.</p><p><i>
Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs</i></p><p>
OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with.</p><p>
Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you:</p><ul><li><p>
Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts</p></li><li><p>
Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents</p></li><li><p>
Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions</p></li><li><p>
Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto&rsquo;s document metadata</p></li><li><p>
Intelligently chunk information using the document&rsquo;s layout data</p></li></ul><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Benefits at Reducto</b></h3><p><i>
At Reducto, we&rsquo;re invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here&rsquo;s what we currently offer:</i></p><ul><li><p>
Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging.</p></li><li><p>

We are the vertical AI category leader for the $100 billion communications, public relations, and public affairs industries.</p><p></p><p><br>
Since 2023, we have quietly grown into the largest AI company in this segment. We are backed by leading investors in the segment - including Mark Cuban, who co-led our seed round.</p><p></p><p><br>
A bit more about us:</p><ul><li><p>
We bootstrapped to our first million in ARR and hit profitability before raising our $3.3 million seed round this year.</p></li><li><p>
We&rsquo;re currently growing &gt;10% month-over-month and on track to &gt;3x ARR this year.</p></li><li><p>
We&rsquo;re working with 200+ clients including the Boston Consulting Group, Weber Shandwick, the Gates Foundation, and dozens of government agencies across the country.</p></li><li><p>
We will raise our Series A in early 2026.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What You'll Do</b></p><ul><li><p><b>
Architect &amp; build core backend systems. </b>Drive architectural decisions across our backend stack (Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL). Own features from concept deployment observing users rely on what you built. We&rsquo;re still laying critical foundations (e.g., Postgres vs. Firestore for client-facing data needs), so we value a pragmatic, <i>&ldquo;strong opinions, weakly held&rdquo;</i> mindset &mdash; especially when decisions are expensive to unwind later.</p></li><li><p><b>
Design scalable data infrastructure. </b>Build and maintain pipelines for ingesting, normalizing, indexing, and querying massive, multi-modal datasets across news, social media, policy, and more.</p></li><li><p><b>
Develop performant APIs and services. </b>Create robust interfaces and internal services that power our product end-to-end, ensuring reliability, security, and a seamless experience for customers.</p></li><li><p><b>
Integrate AI into real-world workflows. </b>Productionize LLMs and classical ML models for high-uptime applications &mdash; including prompt execution, embeddings, RAG pipelines, and more.</p></li><li><p><b>
Collaborate closely with users. </b>Join customer calls, listen to pain points, and rapidly iterate to deliver solutions that genuinely move the needle for comms/public affairs teams.</p></li><li><p><b>
Shape Clipbook&rsquo;s engineering culture. </b>As an early engineer, you&rsquo;ll influence everything &mdash; code quality, system design principles, documentation standards, and how we build as a team.</p></li><li><p><b>
We believe leaders stay hands-on:</b> even as we grow, everyone (including managers) continues to ship.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What We&rsquo;re Looking For</b></p><p></p><ul><li><p><b>
3&ndash;5+ years building and scaling production backend systems. </b>You&rsquo;re strong across backend fundamentals (services, data models, distributed systems), with deeper expertise in one or more areas &mdash; and a desire to keep expanding your breadth over time.</p></li><li><p><b>
Genuine excitement to build quickly &amp; ship fast. </b>Clipbook isn&rsquo;t a 9&ndash;5. We&rsquo;re a seed-stage startup (with Series A-level revenue metrics!) with a lot to build and customers relying on us. We care more about what you ship than when/where you work &mdash; but we do believe spending time together in-person (we&rsquo;re hybrid, in the office 2&ndash;3x/week) meaningfully accelerates product velocity and team chemistry.</p></li><li><p><b>
Strong experience with cloud infrastructure, containerization, and CI/CD. </b>We&rsquo;re building systems that will one day serve Fortune 500 executives in real-time &mdash; so reliability matters. Familiarity with AWS/GCP, containerization (Docker/K8s), and CI/CD pipelines ensures we can deliver high uptime and iterate quickly.</p></li><li><p><b>
Experience architecting and optimizing data pipelines &amp; storage systems. </b>Ability to build scalable, cost-efficient data architectures and tune performance for large and variable workloads across text, media, and streaming sources.</p></li><li><p><b>
Strong product sense and a bias for action. </b>We move fast, make decisions with incomplete information, and learn from real customer feedback &mdash; not endless internal debate.</p></li><li><p><b>
A future leader. </b>You&rsquo;ll help shape our engineering culture and can quickly grow into leadership as the company scales.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Bonus Points</b></p><p></p><ul><li><p><b>
LLM integration and MLOps</b> &mdash; fine-tuning, embeddings/RAG pipelines, or RLHF workflows</p></li><li><p><b>
Data ingestion at scale</b> &mdash; web scraping frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer) and API integrations (REST, GraphQL, streaming endpoints)</p></li><li><p><b>
High-throughput backend systems</b> &mdash; asynchronous execution, rate-limiting, distributed architectures</p></li><li><p><b>
Early-stage startup experience or technical founder experience</b> is a huge plus &mdash; you know how to navigate ambiguity, wear many hats, and move from 0 1 quickly.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
What You'll Get:</b></p><p></p><ul><li><p><b>
Compensation:</b> $180K+, high-upside equity (from a team that understands commercial rigor and bootstrapping to 7-figures: pre-seed dilution but with Series A metrics), and full benefits (medical, dental, vision, 401k, unlimited PTO).</p></li><li><p><b>
Ownership:</b> Direct influence on product and company strategy. Ship fast and drive impact.</p></li><li><p><b>
Growth:</b> Opportunity to build and lead a world-class engineering team as we scale.</p></li><li><p><b>
Culture:</b> High trust, low ego, rapid iteration, and a relentless focus on solving real customer problems.</p></li><li><p><b>
Mission:</b> Join a team passionate about building tools that empower leaders to make sense of the world&rsquo;s information chaos.</p></li></ul><p></p><p><b>
Why Join Us as a Backend Engineer?</b></p><p></p><ul><li><p><b>
Shape the future. </b>As one of the very first backend engineers, you&rsquo;ll architect foundational services and data infrastructure that will define Clipbook&rsquo;s technology for years to come.</p></li><li><p><b>
Direct customer impact. </b>What you build will ship quickly and be used by 200+ customers today &mdash; with <b>instant</b> real-world feedback from comms and public affairs teams who rely on Clipbook daily.</p></li><li><p><b>
Technical challenges. </b>Solve the hardest problems in large-scale data engineering, semantic search, and AI-powered analytics across all media modalities &mdash; e.g., how do we process and index a podcast in a way that captures its <b>meaning</b>, not just the transcript?</p></li><li><p><b>
High autonomy. </b>Minimal bureaucracy. A massive surface area to own. You&rsquo;ll have a direct line to customers and founders &mdash; and the ability to drive decisions end-to-end.</p></li><li><p><b>
Career-defining opportunity. </b>Build a category-defining product and company from the ground up &mdash; with outsized equity and a clear path to engineering leadership as we scale.</p></li></ul><p></p><p>

We also build internal platforms and tools that power Finance, Accounting, Billing Operations, Sales and Support, enabling accurate billing, revenue recognition, and operational visibility at OpenAI’s unprecedented scale.
<br><br>
About the Role
<br><br>
As a Full Stack Engineer on the Financial Experience team, you will design, build, and operate user-facing interfaces and backend services that form the backbone of OpenAI’s commercial engine.

Design and evolve the architecture for core billing flows including invoices, payments, subscriptions, purchase controls, and enterprise usage transparency.
<br><br>
Develop internal tooling and platforms for Finance, Accounting, SalesOps, and Support—including dashboards, workflows, automation, and interfaces to downstream systems.
<br><br>
Collaborate with cross-functional partners to deeply understand financial accuracy, compliance, and operational needs, and translate them into reliable, scalable software.
<br><br>
Ensure correctness and reliability of financial data across systems, with attention to auditing, traceability, and idempotent workflows.
<br><br>
<b>Operate services in production:</b> monitor health, investigate issues, improve reliability, and build safeguards to protect customer trust.
<br><br>
Contribute to shaping the team’s roadmap, technical direction, and engineering culture as we modernize and scale OpenAI’s commercial platform.
<br><br>
<b>You might thrive in this role if you:</b><br>
5+ years of experience building full-stack web applications with strong fundamentals across frontend, backend, and API design.
<br><br>
Proficiency with modern frontend frameworks (e.g., React, TypeScript) and backend technologies (Python preferred; Node, Go, or similar also welcome).
<br><br>
Experience designing or working with scalable backend systems, data models, and event-driven or workflow architectures.
<br><br>
Strong product instincts and passion for building intuitive, high-reliability user experiences.
<br><br>
Experience working in environments where correctness, traceability, and data integrity matter—e.g., billing, payments, finance, enterprise SaaS, or similar domains (preferred, not required).
<br><br>
Comfort owning features end-to-end across UI, APIs, data, and operations.
<br><br>
Ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional partners and communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Your software will directly drive the execution and management of hardware accelerated neural network models deep within the SOC's Neuron Cores.
<br>
<br>
You'll also work closely with our architecture and design teams to drive hardware/software co-design, developing both firmware and custom hardware that enables ML within our accelerator chips. Our team's charter is to make deep learning pervasive for everyday software developers and to democratize access to industry leading infrastructure - you'll be enabling that vision from the ground up.
