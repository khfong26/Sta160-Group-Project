Our team leveraged Azure Data Lake Storage for external volume dumps, semantic modeling for streamlined analytics, and Fabric F256 SKU with autoscale for optimized compute. The result: report load times dropped by 80%, refresh cycles shrank from 10 days to minutes, and infrastructure costs fell by 60%, setting a new benchmark for enterprise-grade reporting performance. We helped a global industrial technology leader transform its construction operations by replacing a fragmented, batch-based ERP system with a real-time intelligence solution built on Microsoft Fabric. The previous setup&mdash;based on Databricks and Snowflake&mdash;struggled with delayed data updates, high maintenance, and siloed systems. By implementing Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence capabilities, including Eventstreams, Reflex, and Power BI dashboards, we enabled real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, and instant insights. The result: 20&ndash;30% cost savings, 50% less IT maintenance, and a 10x improvement in data latency. This empowered faster decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and a more agile, data-driven organization. We helped a Fortune 500 office supply retailer modernize its reporting by migrating from MicroStrategy to Power BI. The legacy system was costly and inefficient, requiring over 150 duplicate reports and individual licenses for each user. Our solution consolidated these into just five dynamic Power BI reports, each customizable with bookmarks and filters. By leveraging Snowflake and Import Mode, we delivered a scalable semantic model and a user-friendly experience. The result: reduced license costs, faster reporting, and empowered business users with self-service analytics. We built an AI-powered chatbot for a global manufacturer of industrial test and diagnostic equipment to improve access to project lifecycle management data. Using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure App Service, the solution indexed documents from SharePoint&mdash;including PDFs, Excel files, and dynamic web pages&mdash;into a centralized, searchable interface. Power Automate and custom code streamlined data ingestion and processing, while Azure Cosmos DB stored historical interactions. The chatbot enabled employees to retrieve accurate insights quickly, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making. Post-deployment, the client achieved higher productivity, lower operational costs, and seamless access to project data through a single unified interface.
