The Opportunity As our founding Forward Deployed Engineer at Reducto, you'll be at the front lines with our customers&mdash;deploying and tuning our systems in real-world environments. You'll bridge the gap between our core engineering team and the unique, complex needs of our enterprise users. Moreover, you'll build out the foundation of how this org will grow and expand.

You're excellent with Python and can navigate Bash and infrastructure as needed. You're very comfortable with Kubernetes. Tools: Build your own tools as needed&mdash;like a quick Streamlit app to test hypotheses or create a dataset. Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users. The core work will include: Deploying and maintaining on-prem and VPC instances of Reducto's systems, often with complex enterprise constraints (e.g. air-gapped, custom auth, strict latency targets). Building tooling to make deployments faster, more reliable, and easier to debug. Creating diagnostics, dashboards, and eval harnesses to measure performance and track regressions across environments. Writing crisp internal documentation and playbooks for repeatable deployments. Collaborating closely with customers, support, and core engineers to identify high-impact improvements. Acting as a feedback loop to the product and infra teams&mdash;surfacing usability gaps, unmet needs, and opportunities to deepen customer value. Working directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction and engineering strategy Bonus points if you: Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people Keep up with the latest developments in ML/AI This is an in person role at our office in SF.

The vast majority of enterprise data &mdash; from financial statements to health records &mdash; is locked in unstructured file formats like PDFs and spreadsheets. We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale. We've grown incredibly quickly, growing revenue by 7x YOY, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm). We're raised over 100M from world class investors like A16z, Benchmark, and First Round Capital, and are hiring a Design Engineer. The Role As a Design Engineer, you'll own the development of Reducto Studio, our Next.js-based application that makes document parsing accessible to both technical and non-technical users. You'll work on everything from interactive document viewers to data extraction workflows, building delightful experiences that make complex AI capabilities feel simple. We would love to meet you if you: Philosophy: You are your own worst critic. You have a high bar for quality and don't rest until the job is done right&mdash;no settling for 90%. We want someone who ships fast, with high agency, and who doesn't just voice problems but actively jumps in to fix them. Experience: You have 2+ years of experience building real world frontend applications with modern frameworks Language/Skills: You're exceptional at TypeScript and React, with strong design sensibility. You understand both the technical and visual aspects of great product experiences. Tools: Build your own tools as needed&mdash;like a quick prototype to test a new interaction pattern or a component library to speed up development. Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users. The Core Work Will Include: Building and improving Reducto Studio's core features&mdash;document viewers, extraction workflows, data visualization, and editing interfaces Creating delightful, intuitive UIs for complex document parsing capabilities like form filling, table extraction, and structured data output Implementing real-time collaboration features and responsive interfaces that work seamlessly across devices Working within our design system and stack (Next.js, Tailwind, Convex) to ship fast while maintaining high quality Experimenting with new interaction patterns to make AI-powered document processing feel magical Working directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction based on user feedback Bonus points if you: Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages Have experience with document viewers, PDF rendering, or complex data visualization Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people Keep up with the latest developments in frontend engineering and design systems This is an in person role at our office in SF. We're an early stage company which means that the role requires working hard and moving quickly. Please only apply if that excites you. About Reducto Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that's simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn't an inconvenience&mdash;it's a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week. Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with. Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you: Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto's document metadata Intelligently chunk information using the document's layout data Benefits at Reducto At Reducto, we're invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here's what we currently offer: Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging. Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we'll take care of the costs Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision. Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar. Parental Leave: Work with us to build a leave schedule that works for you and your family Reducto is an Equal Opportunity Employer committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

When people finance GPU clusters, the datacenters housing them, and the infrastructure powering them, they need ""offtake"" - meaning someone has signed a contract to lease the cluster for a period of time before its even built. Financing a GPU cluster is inherently risky, since margins are thin and volumes are huge. Lenders don't want to take on the risk that cluster developers can't repay their loan, and cluster developers really don't want to risk not selling their cluster. As a result, risk is offloaded to the customer using fixed-price long-term contracts. If you don't mitigate this customer risk, there's a bubble. This isn't SaaS anymore - application layer companies sign multi-year contracts for computer and inference, but sell to customers on monthly subscriptions. If you mess up a purchase, it's game over: a minor shift in your revenue growth rate might mean the difference between profit or bankruptcy. But what if companies could exit their contract by selling it back to the market? Otherwise, as AI scales, compute only becomes available to folks who can effectively take on that risk. A 2-person startup in a San Francisco Victorian can't realistically sign a 5-year take or pay contract on $100m supercomputers. But they may be able to buy the month of liquidity that someone else sold back. So that's what we make: a liquid market for GPU offtake. About the Role We're looking for a high agency engineer to help build the compute delivery platform that powers our ""offtake machine"". In this role, you will develop novel systems that integrate our compute market with the orchestration software managing virtual machines running on cutting-edge HPC hardware worth billions of dollars.

Here's what they said. At most companies, engineers wait. Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved. At Jerry.ai, we don't wait. If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: ""At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it."" That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you'll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. ""Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,"" said another. ""And things move fast."" We don't do bureaucracy. We don't do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. ""The leaders here lead by example,"" one teammate shared. ""They have very high standards. They don't settle for just OK."" It's challenging work, but it's meaningful. You'll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You'll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: ""I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time."" We're a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind. So, what is Jerry.ai and why should you care? Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you'll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we're building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both.

Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build. Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills.
