The vast majority of enterprise data &mdash; from financial statements to health records &mdash; is locked in unstructured file formats like PDFs and spreadsheets. We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale. We've grown incredibly quickly, growing revenue by 7x YOY, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm). We've raised over 100M from world class investors like A16z, Benchmark, and First Round Capital, and are looking for a Backend/AI Engineer. The Opportunity As a Backend/AI Engineer, you'll work on our core API that powers document parsing for hundreds of companies. You'll integrate cutting-edge LLMs, optimize document processing pipelines, and build the infrastructure that makes state-of-the-art document understanding accessible at scale. We would love to meet you if you: Philosophy: You are your own worst critic. You have a high bar for quality and don't rest until the job is done right&mdash;no settling for 90%. We want someone who ships fast, with high agency, and who doesn't just voice problems but actively jumps in to fix them. Experience: You have 2+ years of experience building real world applications and integrating LLMs into production systems Language: You're exceptional at Python Tools: Build your own tools as needed&mdash;like a quick Streamlit app to test hypotheses or create a dataset. Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users. The core work will include: Integrating and optimizing LLM calls for structured extraction, form filling, and document understanding tasks Making improvements to API design and pre-processing algorithms (chunking, structured extraction, etc.) based on customer feedback Building and improving document processing pipelines that handle everything from PDFs to spreadsheets at scale Experimenting with new techniques and output structures to improve LLM accuracy and reduce latency Building internal tooling and evals to better understand/analyze failure cases Working directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction and engineering strategy Bonus points if you: Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages Have experience with prompt engineering, fine-tuning, or building AI agents Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people Keep up with the latest developments in ML/AI This is an in person role at our office in SF. We're an early stage company which means that the role requires working hard and moving quickly. Please only apply if that excites you. About Reducto Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that's simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn't an inconvenience&mdash;it's a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week. Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with. Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you: Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto's document metadata Intelligently chunk information using the document's layout data Benefits at Reducto At Reducto, we're invested in the well-being and growth of our team. Here's what we currently offer: Unlimited PTO: We believe great work requires recharging. Lunch: Receive a free lunch to eat with your teammates daily at the office Reimbursed Transportation: Provide us with your receipts and we'll take care of the costs Insurance: Generous health insurance covering medical, dental, and vision. Health and Wellness Budget: We provide up to $150/mo reimbursement for health and wellness spending, such as gym memberships, fitness classes, or similar. Parental Leave: Work with us to build a leave schedule that works for you and your family Reducto is an Equal Opportunity Employer committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace.

These Superhumans combine a face, a voice, and a GTM brain &mdash; equipped with deep technical and product knowledge. They can lead unlimited, simultaneous conversations 24/7, meeting buyers when they're most active and engaged. Superhumans qualify leads, book meetings, deliver pitches, give interactive demos, handle objections, uncover pain points, build value models, provide support, and onboard customers. They live across websites, inside your product, can join live calls as active participants, and work alongside your team in deal rooms. 1mind Superhumans integrate seamlessly into existing workflows, scale instantly, and drive measurable impact &mdash; growing revenue, reducing headcount, accelerating pipeline to closed-won, and creating a more delightful buyer experience. Job Description We're looking for a Frontend Engineer to craft the interfaces that make advanced AI accessible and intuitive. You'll partner closely with design, product, research/ML, and backend teams to build responsive, performant, and secure web applications that bring 1mind's Superhumans to life across websites, product surfaces, deal rooms, and live sessions. While the role is frontend-first, engineers who can contribute across the stack (especially full-stack with a frontend emphasis) will thrive. Key Responsibilities Build and maintain scalable web applications using modern TypeScript/JavaScript, React, and related tooling. Create reusable UI components, design systems, and front-end infrastructure that accelerate product development. Optimize client performance (TTI/LCP/CLS) and ensure accessibility across browsers and devices. Collaborate with designers to deliver intuitive, high-fidelity interfaces that feel fast and polished. Integrate with backend APIs and real-time services that power multimodal, low-latency Superhuman interactions. Uphold reliability, security, and best practices in testing, CI/CD, and observability for frontend systems. Contribute to end-to-end product planning and decision-making, from discovery to launch and iteration. Qualifications Up to ~6 years of experience building production web applications (or equivalent impactful project work). Fluency in TypeScript/JavaScript, React, and modern web tooling (bundlers, testing frameworks). Strong attention to design fidelity, performance, and accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav, screen readers). Solid grasp of frontend architecture: state management, routing, API integration, caching, error handling. Familiarity with security and privacy fundamentals in the browser (CSP, auth flows, XSS/CSRF mitigations). Plus: Experience with real-time UX (websockets/WebRTC), data-viz, or multimedia (audio/video) surfaces. Plus: Comfort collaborating across the stack (Node/Edge functions), or with design systems/theming. Why Join Us? Shape the UX of multimodal Superhumans redefining how enterprises engage customers and operate. Ship at a high velocity with a small, senior team, real impact from day one. Work at the intersection of AI, product, and systems, partnering directly with ML/IR and backend teams. Global, high-ownership culture (San Francisco & Bengaluru) focused on measurable outcomes and craft. You Might Thrive Here If You Care deeply about design quality, performance, and accessibility. Enjoy iterating quickly to deliver polished, user-focused features. Like owning problems end-to-end and collaborating across product, design, and engineering.

We are the vertical AI category leader for the $100 billion communications, public relations, and public affairs industries. Since 2023, we have quietly grown into the largest AI company in this segment. We are backed by leading investors in the segment - including Mark Cuban, who co-led our seed round. A bit more about us: We bootstrapped to our first million in ARR and hit profitability before raising our $3.3 million seed round this year. We're currently growing >10% month-over-month and on track to >3x ARR this year. We're working with 200+ clients including the Boston Consulting Group, Weber Shandwick, the Gates Foundation, and dozens of government agencies across the country. We will raise our Series A in early 2026. What You'll Do Architect & build core backend systems. Drive architectural decisions across our backend stack (Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL). Own features from concept deployment observing users rely on what you built. We're still laying critical foundations (e.g., Postgres vs. Firestore for client-facing data needs), so we value a pragmatic, ""strong opinions, weakly held"" mindset &mdash; especially when decisions are expensive to unwind later. Design scalable data infrastructure. Build and maintain pipelines for ingesting, normalizing, indexing, and querying massive, multi-modal datasets across news, social media, policy, and more. Develop performant APIs and services. Create robust interfaces and internal services that power our product end-to-end, ensuring reliability, security, and a seamless experience for customers. Integrate AI into real-world workflows. Productionize LLMs and classical ML models for high-uptime applications &mdash; including prompt execution, embeddings, RAG pipelines, and more. Collaborate closely with users. Join customer calls, listen to pain points, and rapidly iterate to deliver solutions that genuinely move the needle for comms/public affairs teams. Shape Clipbook's engineering culture. As an early engineer, you'll influence everything &mdash; code quality, system design principles, documentation standards, and how we build as a team. We believe leaders stay hands-on: even as we grow, everyone (including managers) continues to ship. What We're Looking For 3&ndash;5+ years building and scaling production backend systems. You're strong across backend fundamentals (services, data models, distributed systems), with deeper expertise in one or more areas &mdash; and a desire to keep expanding your breadth over time. Genuine excitement to build quickly & ship fast. Clipbook isn't a 9&ndash;5. We're a seed-stage startup (with Series A-level revenue metrics!) with a lot to build and customers relying on us. We care more about what you ship than when/where you work &mdash; but we do believe spending time together in-person (we're hybrid, in the office 2&ndash;3x/week) meaningfully accelerates product velocity and team chemistry. Strong experience with cloud infrastructure, containerization, and CI/CD. We're building systems that will one day serve Fortune 500 executives in real-time &mdash; so reliability matters. Familiarity with AWS/GCP, containerization (Docker/K8s), and CI/CD pipelines ensures we can deliver high uptime and iterate quickly. Experience architecting and optimizing data pipelines & storage systems. Ability to build scalable, cost-efficient data architectures and tune performance for large and variable workloads across text, media, and streaming sources. Strong product sense and a bias for action. We move fast, make decisions with incomplete information, and learn from real customer feedback &mdash; not endless internal debate. A future leader. You'll help shape our engineering culture and can quickly grow into leadership as the company scales. Bonus Points LLM integration and MLOps &mdash; fine-tuning, embeddings/RAG pipelines, or RLHF workflows Data ingestion at scale &mdash; web scraping frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer) and API integrations (REST, GraphQL, streaming endpoints) High-throughput backend systems &mdash; asynchronous execution, rate-limiting, distributed architectures Early-stage startup experience or technical founder experience is a huge plus &mdash; you know how to navigate ambiguity, wear many hats, and move from 0 1 quickly. What You'll Get: Compensation: $180K+, high-upside equity (from a team that understands commercial rigor and bootstrapping to 7-figures: pre-seed dilution but with Series A metrics), and full benefits (medical, dental, vision, 401k, unlimited PTO). Ownership: Direct influence on product and company strategy. Ship fast and drive impact. Growth: Opportunity to build and lead a world-class engineering team as we scale. Culture: High trust, low ego, rapid iteration, and a relentless focus on solving real customer problems. Mission: Join a team passionate about building tools that empower leaders to make sense of the world's information chaos. Why Join Us as a Backend Engineer? Shape the future. As one of the very first backend engineers, you'll architect foundational services and data infrastructure that will define Clipbook's technology for years to come. Direct customer impact. What you build will ship quickly and be used by 200+ customers today &mdash; with instant real-world feedback from comms and public affairs teams who rely on Clipbook daily. Technical challenges. Solve the hardest problems in large-scale data engineering, semantic search, and AI-powered analytics across all media modalities &mdash; e.g., how do we process and index a podcast in a way that captures its meaning , not just the transcript? High autonomy. Minimal bureaucracy. A massive surface area to own. You'll have a direct line to customers and founders &mdash; and the ability to drive decisions end-to-end. Career-defining opportunity. Build a category-defining product and company from the ground up &mdash; with outsized equity and a clear path to engineering leadership as we scale.
