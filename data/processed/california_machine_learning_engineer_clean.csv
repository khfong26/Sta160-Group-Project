Our Story Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. While together at Google, they were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn't used for enterprise products and services inside the company.The quality just wasn't there. So they set out to build something better. LILT was born. LILT has been a machine learning company since its founding in 2015. At the time, machine translation didn't meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so LILT assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, LILT has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, human-in-the-loop systems, and now agentic AI. With AI innovation accelerating and enterprise demand growing, the next phase of LILT's journey is just beginning.

The vast majority of enterprise data &mdash; from financial statements to health records &mdash; is locked in unstructured file formats like PDFs and spreadsheets. We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale. We've grown incredibly quickly, growing revenue by 7x YOY, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm). We've raised over 100M from world class investors like A16z, Benchmark, and First Round Capital, and are hiring a Machine Learning Engineer to help us train and deploy the models critical to the performance of our core product. We would love to meet you if you: Philosophy: You are your own worst critic. You have a high bar for quality and don't rest until the job is done right&mdash;no settling for 90%. We want someone who ships fast, with high agency, and who doesn't just voice problems but actively jumps in to fix them. Experience: You have 2+ years of experience with training, fine tuning, and evaluating ML models used in production systems Language/Skills: You're exceptional at Python or similar, and are well versed with both traditional computer vision and VLMs Tools: Build your own tools as needed&mdash;like a quick Streamlit app to test hypotheses or create a dataset.

We're an early stage company which means that the role requires working hard and moving quickly. Please only apply if that excites you. About Reducto Nearly 80% of enterprise data is in unstructured formats like PDFs PDFs are the status quo for enterprise knowledge in nearly every industry. Insurance claims, financial statements, invoices, and health records are all stored in a structure that's simply impractical for use in digital workflows. This isn't an inconvenience&mdash;it's a critical bottleneck that leads to dozens of wasted hours every week. Traditional approaches fail at reliably extracting information in complex PDFs OCR and even more sophisticated ML approaches work for simple text documents but are unreliable for anything more complex. Text from different columns are jumbled together, figures are ignored, and tables are a nightmare to get right. Overcoming this usually requires a large engineering effort dedicated to building specialized pipelines for every document type you work with. Reducto breaks document layouts into subsections and then contextually parses each depending on the type of content. This is made possible by a combination of vision models, LLMs, and a suite of heuristics we built over time. Put simply, we can help you: Accurately extract text and tables even with nonstandard layouts Automatically convert graphs to tabular data and summarize images in documents Extract important fields from complex forms with simple, natural language instructions Build powerful retrieval pipelines using Reducto's document metadata Intelligently chunk information using the document's layout data Benefits at Reducto At Reducto, we're invested in the well-being and growth of our team.

Here's what they said. At most companies, engineers wait. Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved. At Jerry.ai, we don't wait. If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: ""At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it."" That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you'll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. ""Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,"" said another. ""And things move fast."" We don't do bureaucracy. We don't do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. ""The leaders here lead by example,"" one teammate shared. ""They have very high standards. They don't settle for just OK."" It's challenging work, but it's meaningful. You'll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You'll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: ""I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time."" We're a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind. So, what is Jerry.ai and why should you care? Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you'll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage. At Jerry.ai, we're building the first super app to help everyday Americans take control of both. From insurance to repairs to safety, we're reimagining what it means to own and maintain your car and home. This is a $5 trillion+ problem and we're the only company tackling it end-to-end. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we're profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M 50M users next. What you'll work on: Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage. Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1&ndash;2 weeks on average. Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules. Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences . Optimize and scale our internal tools (think: in-house DocuSign for servicing) to reduce agent intervention to nearly zero. Collaborate closely with product, data, and engineering ops to anticipate churn and improve customer retention . Work asynchronously across time zones, with minimal meetings but strong collaboration through Asana and Slack. Continuously improve our backend systems, APIs, and microservice architecture. Our tech stack: Frontend & backend: TypeScript, Nest.js, Next.js, React, React Native, Expo API: GraphQL Data: Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse, Redis Infrastructure: AWS, microservices, containerized services on ECS/EKS, asynchronous processing on Lambda Our business has grown more complex over time. We're refactoring major parts of our code base &mdash; simplifying old systems, rebuilding core flows, and setting up the next three years of our platform's growth. You'll help build the foundation for that next phase. What we're looking for: Experience: At least 2 years full stack engineering experience building production-grade software, ideally prior experience building large scale distributed systems for a fast-growing consumer-facing software Technical strength: Strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and systems design matter more than prior experience with our tech stack. Problem solver: You enjoy tackling ambiguous problems, breaking them down into actionable code, and iterating quickly. Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build. Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously with a global team, with excellent communication skills. Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture. This isn't another coding job. You'll work in a flexible , fast-moving, and highly collaborative culture , where innovation is encouraged , your voice is heard , and the impact of your work is immediate . You'll tackle meaningful challenges, learn, and grow alongside talented peers. If this sounds like your kind of place, we'd love to meet you!

Here's what they said. At most companies, engineers wait. Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved. At Jerry.ai, we don't wait. If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: ""At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it."" That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you'll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. ""Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,"" said another. ""And things move fast."" We don't do bureaucracy. We don't do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. ""The leaders here lead by example,"" one teammate shared. ""They have very high standards. They don't settle for just OK."" It's challenging work, but it's meaningful. You'll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You'll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: ""I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time."" We're a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites.

We're Jerry.ai. We're building the first AI-powered AllCar&trade; super app to make car ownership affordable, seamless, and even magical. From insurance to repairs to road safety, we're connecting the entire car ownership experience into one mobile-first platform. Our revenue has grown 60x in the last 5 years, we're profitable, and our goal is to scale from 5M 50M users next. We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our Core Marketplace Automation Team , building automation systems that let our users self-serve, stay insured, and get the smoothest experience possible. This is a rare opportunity to work on software that directly impacts millions of users , automate complex business processes , and shape the future of insurance tech. Why you'll love working here Real world impact: Your code touches millions of end users every day. Our automation systems already handle complex tasks like document uploads/verification, policy changes, payment, cancellations, and renewals &mdash; now we need to make them faster, smarter, and more seamless. Meaningful work : Build tools that automate hundreds of human agent hours and scale our business efficiently. You'll tackle different types of challenges every day, learning both the technical and business sides of our core products. Zero bureaucracy: Have an idea? Pitch it, implement it, and see it live in days. No red tape, no slow-moving processes. Brilliant + supportive teammates: Work with talented and kind engineers, product managers, and data scientists. Be in an environment that encourages challenging the status quo, innovation, collaboration, and helping each other succeed. Flexibility: Work on projects that excite you. Explore new technologies, like AI/LLM tools, early &mdash; without bureaucracy slowing you down. Remote-friendly and flexible work arrangements allowing you to balance life and work, even internationally. Growth + learning: Engineers at Jerry get to take a ton of ownership, swim outside their lanes, level up quickly, and mentor others. Everyone is passionate, involved, and cares intensely about their work and their teammates. What you'll do Build automation systems that handle complex insurance servicing tasks end-to-end (policy endorsements, cancellations, document uploads, reinstatements) or reduce policy cancellations, improve renewals, and ensure users always have the best coverage. Fast sprint cycles: ship new automations in 1&ndash;2 weeks on average. Compose backend business logic that drives automation while respecting complex insurance carrier rules. Design backend pipelines that sync customer policy data, deliver timely alerts, and power seamless re-shopping experiences .

Ownership: You take responsibility for end-to-end outcomes and continuously improve the systems you build. Collaboration: Comfortable working asynchronously across teams and time zones, with excellent communication skills. Curiosity + adaptability: You love learning, exploring new tools, and stepping outside your comfort zone to understand the bigger picture.

Here's what they said. At most companies, engineers wait. Wait for approvals. Wait for dependencies. Wait while real problems go unsolved. At Jerry.ai, we don't wait. If you have an idea, you can explain it, build it, and ship it &mdash; sometimes in days, not months. One engineer told us: ""At other companies I made very little difference. Here, if I have a good idea, I can go do it."" That sense of ownership is built into how we work. We move fast, and you'll see your fingerprints on the product right away. Engineers here love being able to touch every layer of the stack, collaborate across teams, and see their work reflected in real customer behavior &mdash; sometimes the same week they ship. ""Everything you do reflects immediately for the users,"" said another. ""And things move fast."" We don't do bureaucracy. We don't do politics. Everyone here &mdash; from our CTO to our tech leads &mdash; writes code and sweats the details. ""The leaders here lead by example,"" one teammate shared. ""They have very high standards. They don't settle for just OK."" It's challenging work, but it's meaningful. You'll juggle new systems and old, context switch often, and learn constantly. You'll also get more trust and autonomy than almost anywhere else. Engineers describe the culture as curious and collaborative: people step up to help, push each other to grow, and learn from every mistake. One teammate summed it up perfectly: ""I once caused a bug that wasted $20K in AWS costs, but no one blamed me. They only cared about how to prevent it next time."" We're a remote-first, global team with engineers across North America and Asia. We collaborate asynchronously, meet regularly to share context, and connect in person at our global offsites. Our engineers joined for the impact and stayed for the people: talented, no ego, and genuinely kind. So, what is Jerry.ai and why should you care? Your car and your home are the two most expensive things you'll ever own &mdash; and the hardest to manage.
