We're building a full-stack AI-native psychiatry network &mdash;our clinicians provide high-quality care directly to patients, and AI agents automate all parts of our care operations (e.g., scheduling, risk analysis, billing, etc.). Our vision? A patient experience that's 10X better, more affordable, and higher-margin than ever before. Today, we're turning weeks-long wait times into same-day appointments, crafting seamless digital experiences in a broken healthcare system, and scaling a company that patients genuinely trust. The Opportunity One of the largest drivers of new patients is insurance&#8209;payer provider directories . Accurate, telehealth&#8209;friendly listings translate directly into lives helped&mdash;and revenue realized. We need a detail&#8209;obsessed contractor to own these directories end&#8209;to&#8209;end. You will audit, correct, and continuously optimize Legion's listings across every payer's member portal and directory, then route patients who discover us there into our touchless, self&#8209;serve onboarding funnel. This role is perfect for a virtual assistant, data&#8209;entry specialist, or health&#8209;tech ops contractor who loves hunting down discrepancies, working with spreadsheets/APIs, and turning ""Call our office"" into a one&#8209;click digital experience. Directory Audit & Cleanup Build a master inventory of all Legion provider entries (NPIs, specialties, locations) across every contracted payer and network. Identify and fix errors: outdated addresses, missing telehealth flags, wrong specialties, inactive providers, duplicate listings, broken URLs. Standardize naming conventions, taxonomy codes, and ""Accepting New Patients"" indicators. Prominence & Search&#8209;Rank Boosting Partner with payer directory teams to surface Legion higher in search results (e.g., ""telepsychiatry,"" ""virtual psychiatry Texas""). Ensure telehealth filter toggles, map pins, and specialty filters return Legion providers. Push for featured badges or ""virtual visit"" tags wherever available. Touchless Patient Routing Replace phone&#8209;only CTAs with direct links to Legion landing pages, self&#8209;scheduling URLs, or SMS short&#8209;codes. Create and maintain unique UTM&#8209;tagged links per payer to track source intake visit conversion. Collaborate with Growth and Engineering to A/B&#8209;test landing pages and measure drop&#8209;off. Data Sync & Governance Establish a single ""source of truth"" spreadsheet or Airtable containing provider data, directory status, update dates, and payer contacts. Set up monthly sweeps (manual or scripted) to confirm listings remain accurate after payer updates. Reporting & Impact Deliver weekly dashboards covering percentage of error&#8209;free listings, directory&#8209;sourced intakes, and conversion rates to scheduled visits. Quantify incremental patient volume and revenue unlocked by each directory fix. You'll Be Successful If You&hellip; Sweat the details &mdash;typos in an address mean lost patients; you catch them all. Speak both ""payer"" and ""patient"" &mdash;you can push a network&#8209;ops rep for an XML file and write patient&#8209;friendly CTA copy. Automate whenever possible &mdash;simple scripts, Airtable automations, PostHog funnels&mdash;whatever keeps manual work near zero. Own outcomes &mdash;you measure success in booked appointments, not completed forms. Ideal Background 2+ years in provider&#8209;data management, revenue&#8209;cycle ops, health&#8209;plan credentialing, or growth ops for telehealth. Proven experience updating payer directories (Availity, CAQH, HealthSmart, etc.) or physician&#8209;finder tools. Comfortable wrangling large CSVs, VLOOKUPs, and basic SQL/API calls. Familiar with UTM tracking, analytics, and funnel metrics. Bonus: Knowledge of NPI registry, taxonomy codes, and Texas payer landscape. Engagement Details Scope: ~20-40 hrs/week (first 3 months project&#8209;based; renewable). Compensation: Competitive hourly rate (1099) + bonuses tied to strong performance Tools: PostHog, analytics dashboards, and direct payer portals. Why Legion? Every directory you fix puts life&#8209;changing psychiatric care in front of people who may have waited months&mdash;and lets our clinicians focus on healing, not paperwork.
