Today the company runs one of the world's largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company. We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us! Available Location: Austin, Lisbon, London Role Summary Cloudflare is building the future of the Internet, and the Workers platform is at the forefront of that mission. We're looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join the team behind Durable Object, our globally-distributed, strongly-consistent coordination and state primitive, focusing on the Developer Experience. You will be responsible for the entire developer journey, from their first line of code to their production deployment and debugging. You'll work with the Workers engineering and product teams to build the APIs, Javscript SDKs, and observability features that make building stateful applications on the edge intuitive, reliable, and maybe even a little bit fun. We're looking for a pragmatic, product-minded engineer who is obsessed with developer ergonomics and has felt the pain of deploying complex applications in the cloud. Role Responsibilities Design, build, and maintain the primary developer-facing surfaces for Durable Objects, including our command-line tooling (wrangler), APIs, SDKs, and dashboard. Own the end-to-end developer workflow, from creating intuitive local testing and simulation environments to building powerful debugging and observability tools for a globally distributed system. Act as a technical leader and mentor on the team, driving engineering quality through rigorous code and design reviews. Innovate on solutions to the unique challenges of managing and migrating state at the edge, ensuring developers can deploy with confidence. Collaborate closely with product managers, developer advocates, and support engineers to translate developer feedback into a concrete product roadmap. Author high-quality technical documentation, tutorials, and example applications that inspire developers and accelerate their time-to-production. Triage, investigate, and resolve complex bugs and performance issues reported by the large and growing community of developers building on Durable Objects. Role Requirements Must-Have Skills 5+ years of professional software engineering experience, with a significant portion dedicated to building developer-facing tools, APIs, or cloud infrastructure. Deep, hands-on experience building, deploying, and operating applications on at least one major cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, or Cloudflare Workers). Strong proficiency in TypeScript/JavaScript and an interest in C++/Rust. A ""product-first"" mindset and a strong sense of empathy for developers; you get annoyed when tools are hard to use, and you're driven to fix them. Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to articulate complex distributed systems concepts to a wide range of audiences. A proven track record of taking ownership of complex projects and delivering them from inception to production in a distributed, asynchronous team environment. Nice-to-Have Skills Direct experience building applications with Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects (we'd love to see what you've built!). Experience with distributed systems concepts, particularly actor-based models (like Erlang/OTP or Akka), consensus algorithms, or distributed databases. Active contributions to open-source developer tools or libraries. What Makes Cloudflare Special? We're not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We're a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet. Project Galileo : Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare's enterprise customers-at no cost. Athenian Project : In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states. 1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers. Sound like something you'd like to be a part of?

Engineers who join this team work on systems that coordinate deployments, enforce policy, and automate complex operational processes for thousands of internal users. The impact of our work is measured not in how fast we ship code, but in how much cognitive load and manual effort we remove for the engineers who rely on our platform. This is a team that values thoughtful engineering. Every feature must account for real-world failure modes, compliance constraints, and user experience. We design APIs and workflows so the safe path is the obvious path, and risky actions are either impossible or self-evident. We treat operational learning as input to product direction: when something becomes a repetitive pain point for support, compliance, or service teams, we encode the behavior into automation&mdash;not documentation or tribal knowledge. Engineers here are expected to think end-to-end: from design and implementation to rollout, telemetry, and iteration. We build observable systems with explicit behavior, predictable rollback paths, and clear semantics. We write documentation not because someone required it, but because shared understanding is how a high-performing platform team scales. The people who thrive here are curious, candid, and motivated by making complex systems feel simple for others.

Participate in an operations/support rotation where hands-on experience directly informs product design decisions. Write high-quality documentation that creates a shared understanding of system behavior, design trade-offs, and operational semantics.

When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don't get paged for the same issue twice. Mentorship & Career Growth: Our team is dedicated to supporting new members. We have a broad mix of experience levels and tenures, and we're building an environment that celebrates knowledge sharing and mentorship. Our senior members enjoy one-on-one mentoring and thorough, but kind, code reviews.
