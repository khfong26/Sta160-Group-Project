As a QA Analyst, you'll design and execute test plans that validate functionality, durability, and compliance of the manufacturing software platform. You'll report to the Product Manager of Factory Systems and work closely with backend, frontend, robotics, and DevOps engineers. What You'll Do Define, maintain, and execute manual and automated test plans across services, APIs, and user interfaces. Validate factory-critical workflows: work order execution, part genealogy, traceability, and inventory accuracy. Develop regression suites that prevent defects from reappearing in production. Collaborate with engineers to design testable requirements, acceptance criteria, and edge cases. Build and monitor QA pipelines in CI/CD, enabling automated validation before each release. Verify system behavior under load using stress and performance testing tools. Document, track, and prioritize defects; ensure root cause analysis and prevention. Uphold security and compliance standards through test coverage of audit logging, RBAC, encryption, and CMMC controls. Partner with manufacturing and operations teams to validate software performance in a live production setting. The Tools You'll Work With Testing Frameworks: Puppeteer, Playwright, Postman, k6/JMeter CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Kubernetes-based environments Data Validation: SQL, Go/Python (for data checks/automation scripts) Issue Tracking & Docs: Jira, Confluence Security & Compliance: Vault, TLS/mTLS test harnesses, policy-based validation Required Qualifications 3&ndash;5+ years in software QA, including test plan design and execution.

What Success Looks Like After 12 Months All critical factory workflows are covered by comprehensive automated test suites. Defect escape rate to production is reduced to near-zero on mission-critical paths. CI/CD test pipelines block regressions and enable confident, frequent releases. QA dashboards and reports provide clear visibility into product quality trends. Compliance audits are passed with zero findings related to software quality.

Implement immutable infrastructure to prevent drift and simplify configuration management. Store configurations in version control (e.g., Git) for visibility, rollback, and consistency. 2. Assess Current State Lean Approach: Audit current setup using automated tooling (Terraform validate, Ansible dry-run). Perform automated risk assessments (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk). Conduct a gap analysis against CMMI or COBIT to identify high-value improvement areas. 3. Access Control Lean Approach: Implement RBAC with tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS IAM/Azure AD. Adhere to the least privilege principle with dynamic access provisioning via CI/CD. Introduce self-service access requests integrated with automated approval workflows (e.g., Okta, Azure AD). 4. Data Management Lean Approach: Anonymize or use synthetic data in lower environments (DataMasker, Redgate). Automate data refreshes tied to environment updates via CI/CD. Enforce data quality monitoring before testing. 5. Change Management Lean Approach: Adopt lightweight change control focused on stability, security, and compliance using GitOps principles. Implement automated approvals via tools like Jira or ServiceNow. Integrate continuous deployment with gateways (tests, security scans, approvals) to maintain speed without sacrificing stability. 6. Monitoring Lean Approach: Utilize centralized monitoring tools (Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana) for environment health and test results. Enable continuous feedback loops to alert QA and development teams in real time (e.g., Slack, MS Teams notifications). 7. Business Continuity Lean Approach: Set up automated backups using cloud-native tools (AWS Backup, Azure Backup). Regularly test disaster recovery through automated CI/CD pipeline integration. Use cloud redundancy (AWS Availability Zones, Azure Regions) to minimize downtime. Additional General Recommendations Shift Left on Quality: Use automated testing early in the pipeline.
