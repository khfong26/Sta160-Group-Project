The aim is to balance efficiency, compliance, and quality by prioritizing lean solutions that minimize overhead, all while maintaining necessary integrity and security. 1. Environment Provisioning / Configuration Lean Approach: Automate with CI/CD ((e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to eliminate manual processes. Implement immutable infrastructure to prevent drift and simplify configuration management. Store configurations in version control (e.g., Git) for visibility, rollback, and consistency. 2. Assess Current State Lean Approach: Audit current setup using automated tooling (Terraform validate, Ansible dry-run). Perform automated risk assessments (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk). Conduct a gap analysis against CMMI or COBIT to identify high-value improvement areas. 3. Access Control Lean Approach: Implement RBAC with tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS IAM/Azure AD. Adhere to the least privilege principle with dynamic access provisioning via CI/CD. Introduce self-service access requests integrated with automated approval workflows (e.g., Okta, Azure AD). 4. Data Management Lean Approach: Anonymize or use synthetic data in lower environments (DataMasker, Redgate). Automate data refreshes tied to environment updates via CI/CD. Enforce data quality monitoring before testing. 5. Change Management Lean Approach: Adopt lightweight change control focused on stability, security, and compliance using GitOps principles. Implement automated approvals via tools like Jira or ServiceNow. Integrate continuous deployment with gateways (tests, security scans, approvals) to maintain speed without sacrificing stability. 6. Monitoring Lean Approach: Utilize centralized monitoring tools (Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana) for environment health and test results. Enable continuous feedback loops to alert QA and development teams in real time (e.g., Slack, MS Teams notifications). 7. Business Continuity Lean Approach: Set up automated backups using cloud-native tools (AWS Backup, Azure Backup). Regularly test disaster recovery through automated CI/CD pipeline integration. Use cloud redundancy (AWS Availability Zones, Azure Regions) to minimize downtime. Additional General Recommendations Shift Left on Quality: Use automated testing early in the pipeline. Documentation Automation: Use tools like MkDocs or Swagger/OpenAPI for up-to-date documentation. Adopt Environment as Code (Kubernetes, Docker) for reproducible and version-controlled environments. Other Business Support Ensure ITSM practices (Change, Release Management) are consistently followed. Develop, modify, and optimize existing Service Management practices. Collaborate with stakeholders for reliable delivery of software and systems. Assist Program/Project Managers with release calendar planning and stakeholder communication. Conduct release readiness and milestone reviews. Coordinate go-live activities including deployment plans and checklists. Ensure documentation and understanding of release controls across teams. Manage and log all changes in a controlled, coordinated manner. Participate in Change Advisory Board (CAB) meetings and provide oversight for expedite/emergency changes. Evaluate all Requests for Change (RFCs) for business/process impact and risk. Oversee Priority 1 and selected Priority 2 incident resolution and forward to problem management. Conduct post-change reviews and feed insights into RCA processes. Participate in problem management to identify root cause and improve system availability. Analyze incident trends for chronic issues and proactive management.

Examples of our projects: We built an agentic AI solution that redefined event information access for a global technology leader, delivering instant, accurate answers to attendee questions at scale. Using Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search, and Azure Machine Learning, combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we engineered a secure, multilingual Copilot platform capable of processing data from 22 file formats across multiple sources. Our team leveraged Azure Databricks for advanced data transformation, Azure Front Door for global load balancing, and Microsoft Entra ID with Azure Key Vault for enterprise-grade security. The result: a system that served over 200,000 users, handled millions of interactions, and reduced support requests by 70%, setting a new benchmark for scalable, intelligent, and personalized event experiences. We built a high-performance reporting solution that redefined data refresh efficiency for a leading office supply retailer, delivering near real-time insights and dramatically faster report access. By integrating Snowflake-managed Iceberg tables into Microsoft Fabric via OneLake shortcuts and leveraging Power BI's Direct Lake mode, we built a scalable architecture that eliminated data duplication and significantly reduced latency. Our team leveraged Azure Data Lake Storage for external volume dumps, semantic modeling for streamlined analytics, and Fabric F256 SKU with autoscale for optimized compute. The result: report load times dropped by 80%, refresh cycles shrank from 10 days to minutes, and infrastructure costs fell by 60%, setting a new benchmark for enterprise-grade reporting performance. We helped a global industrial technology leader transform its construction operations by replacing a fragmented, batch-based ERP system with a real-time intelligence solution built on Microsoft Fabric. The previous setup&mdash;based on Databricks and Snowflake&mdash;struggled with delayed data updates, high maintenance, and siloed systems. By implementing Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Intelligence capabilities, including Eventstreams, Reflex, and Power BI dashboards, we enabled real-time data ingestion, anomaly detection, and instant insights. The result: 20&ndash;30% cost savings, 50% less IT maintenance, and a 10x improvement in data latency. This empowered faster decision-making, proactive issue resolution, and a more agile, data-driven organization. We helped a Fortune 500 office supply retailer modernize its reporting by migrating from MicroStrategy to Power BI. The legacy system was costly and inefficient, requiring over 150 duplicate reports and individual licenses for each user. Our solution consolidated these into just five dynamic Power BI reports, each customizable with bookmarks and filters. By leveraging Snowflake and Import Mode, we delivered a scalable semantic model and a user-friendly experience. The result: reduced license costs, faster reporting, and empowered business users with self-service analytics. We built an AI-powered chatbot for a global manufacturer of industrial test and diagnostic equipment to improve access to project lifecycle management data. Using Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure App Service, the solution indexed documents from SharePoint&mdash;including PDFs, Excel files, and dynamic web pages&mdash;into a centralized, searchable interface. Power Automate and custom code streamlined data ingestion and processing, while Azure Cosmos DB stored historical interactions. The chatbot enabled employees to retrieve accurate insights quickly, reducing manual effort and improving decision-making. Post-deployment, the client achieved higher productivity, lower operational costs, and seamless access to project data through a single unified interface.

We're assembling a senior engineering group in the Dallas&ndash;Fort Worth metroplex to build this platform from the ground up using a modern, AI-first development environment. Who We Are SafetyChain is a fast-growing B2B SaaS software company. Our industry leading Plant Management Platform helps manufacturers improve yield, maximize productivity, and ensure compliance throughout their operations. Headquartered in Novato, CA, we have a passionate, diverse team with the majority of our employees working remotely across the country to serve our customers. We operate with the fun and flexibility of a start-up combined with the stability of a mature and rapidly growing software company. Our solutions are used every day in thousands of facilities to help our customers make their products better and safer. Customers include many well-known brands like Albertsons, Clif Bar, Driscoll's, Schwan's, See's Candies, Tyson Foods, United Airlines, WholeFoods and White Castle. We believe our culture of ""Help and Hustle"" makes for a great place to work and we foster a dynamic, positive environment that enables our teams to put their creative energies towards solving our customers' problems and supporting each other. Our culture is real, tangible and immensely rewarding. What You'll Do You'll help design and build the foundations of SafetyChain's next-gen platform&mdash;enterprise-grade, AI-enabled, and capable of supporting a wide range of operational workflows across the food & beverage supply chain. This includes: Building high-performance services and applications in an end-to-end TypeScript environment (Deno backend + unified front-end framework). Working in a monorepo with strong engineering conventions and automated tooling to accelerate iteration. Using AI-driven developer workflows (code generation, scaffolding, automated tests, modeling, inference-based data mapping, etc.) to dramatically speed up delivery. Making pragmatic architectural decisions&mdash;knowing when to build, when to buy, and when to rely on the surrounding ecosystem. Designing systems where platforms emerge from real demand rather than speculative abstraction. Contributing to an ""office-first when collaboration matters"" culture that values high-bandwidth problem solving and clear ownership. Building enterprise-scale features with attention to reliability, data semantics, and real-world operational constraints. Partnering closely with Product and AI/ML teams to translate domain complexity into clean, scalable systems. What You Bring You don't need to show up as a TypeScript or Deno expert&mdash;but you must be the kind of engineer who can learn fast, adapt faster, and enjoy working with modern tooling. Core Experience 8+ years building modern web applications or distributed systems (enterprise experience strongly preferred). Strong background in at least one of: TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, or C#. Experience with multiple data storage models&mdash;document, columnar, relational&mdash;and clear reasoning about tradeoffs. Ability to design and debug systems that operate at real-world scale and complexity. A practical mindset: you don't reinvent authentication, messaging, or streaming engines unless there's a damned good reason . Comfort with hybrid work and in-office collaboration for high-context problem-solving. Full-Stack Engineers Experience building and maintaining APIs, data pipelines, or backend primitives. Strong architectural intuition around distributed systems, eventing, and state management. Ability to design clean contracts between backend and frontend. Frontend-Focused Engineers Deep understanding of frontend state, caching, offline behavior, and storage semantics. Experience building rich, responsive interfaces for enterprise or operational users. Ability to work with cross-platform UI scaffolding for web, tablet, and desktop environments. How You Think (the part we screen hardest for) You're allergic to cargo-cult engineering and prefer reasoning from first principles. You default to outcome-based decisions instead of theoretical purity. You don't chase platform work for its own sake&mdash;platforms should emerge from repeated need. You care about simplicity, legibility, and solving the right problem. You're energized by a team of peers who challenge each other and move fast. Why Join Now You'd be joining at the moment the ""next-gen SafetyChain"" becomes real. You'll influence architecture, tooling, culture, AI-assisted workflows, and the entire development model. The team will be senior, tight-knit, and design-driven.
