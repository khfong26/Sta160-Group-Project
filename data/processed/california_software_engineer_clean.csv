The vast majority of enterprise data &mdash; from financial statements to health records &mdash; is locked in unstructured file formats like PDFs and spreadsheets. We train vision models to read those documents the way a human would, and make it possible to build products, train models, and automate processes at scale. We've grown incredibly quickly, growing revenue by 7x YOY, and now work with hundreds of companies ranging from leading AI teams (Harvey, Vanta, Scale), through to enterprise (FAANG, top 3 trading firm).

The Opportunity As our founding Forward Deployed Engineer at Reducto, you'll be at the front lines with our customers&mdash;deploying and tuning our systems in real-world environments. You'll bridge the gap between our core engineering team and the unique, complex needs of our enterprise users. Moreover, you'll build out the foundation of how this org will grow and expand.

Tools: Build your own tools as needed&mdash;like a quick Streamlit app to test hypotheses or create a dataset. Approach: A quantitative approach to building products. Ability to debug, experiment, and iterate fast. You should be comfortable getting hands-on with the full development lifecycle, from ideation to shipping to users. The core work will include: Deploying and maintaining on-prem and VPC instances of Reducto's systems, often with complex enterprise constraints (e.g. air-gapped, custom auth, strict latency targets). Building tooling to make deployments faster, more reliable, and easier to debug. Creating diagnostics, dashboards, and eval harnesses to measure performance and track regressions across environments. Writing crisp internal documentation and playbooks for repeatable deployments. Collaborating closely with customers, support, and core engineers to identify high-impact improvements. Acting as a feedback loop to the product and infra teams&mdash;surfacing usability gaps, unmet needs, and opportunities to deepen customer value. Working directly with the founders and customers to shape the product direction and engineering strategy Bonus points if you: Have prior experience founding a company or building products at early stages Are ambitious and driven, and care a lot about doing great work with great people Keep up with the latest developments in ML/AI This is an in person role at our office in SF.

Our platform uses the largest 6-axis robots on the market to form 2D sheets of metal into complex 3D parts, layer-by-layer. Traditional sheet metal production was designed for scale, not flexibility. It relies on costly dies and tooling that make lower volume projects prohibitively slow and expensive. We're changing that. Whether you're a startup building a few thousand airframes or an automaker prototyping next-generation components, Machina Labs gives you the ability to iterate and manufacture at the speed of software. With support from the venture arms of Toyota, NVIDIA, and Lockheed Martin, we're accelerating the future of manufacturing, one where factories are flexible, production is on-demand, and innovation is unconstrained. About the Role As a Frontend Software Engineer Intern, you'll join our agile engineering team to help build intuitive, visually stunning user interfaces that let users interact with our robotic systems and real-time data. Your work will directly impact how engineers, operators, and customers control, monitor, and visualize advanced manufacturing workflows. This is a hands-on opportunity to apply your creativity in solving complex UI challenges and gain exposure to robotics, data visualization, and cutting-edge software development. What You'll Do Collaborate with engineers and designers to build responsive, performant frontend applications using React and TypeScript. Develop and iterate on user-facing tools for visualizing real-time robot and manufacturing data. Prototype and implement intuitive UI/UX flows for internal tools and external-facing dashboards. Contribute to 3D visualization components for robot status, simulation, and process monitoring (optionally using Three.js or WebGL). Work closely with backend engineers to integrate and visualize live production data via APIs. Support the design system and help ensure visual and functional consistency across Machina Labs software products. Participate in team code reviews, agile ceremonies, and brainstorming sessions to shape product features and technical solutions. What We're Looking For Currently pursuing a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or a related technical field. Expected to complete or have completed final degree within one year of the internship's end. Experience with React (or similar framework) and TypeScript through coursework, personal projects, or internships. Understanding of core UI/UX principles and frontend development best practices.
