We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future. To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals.

That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the best experience, every time.

One Team: We don't think of ourselves as ""Acquisition Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"".

We're building a small, diverse team of exceptional engineers who are excited about the future of agentic coding and care deeply about creating tools that make software development faster and more reliable.

Your experience should reflect a proven ability to lead large-scale projects, elevate team performance, and make technology decisions that directly drive business and healthcare outcomes. Must-Haves: 8-12 years of experience in backend or full-stack software development, with a proven track record in service-oriented architectures and large data systems. Demonstrated architectural experience designing and implementing scalable, distributed systems, including microservices and event-driven architectures. A strong leadership track record in driving technical direction for significant, cross-functional projects. Cloud platform proficiency (preferably AWS), including hands-on experience with infrastructure design, deployment pipelines, and cost optimization.

You prefer a highly structured, top-down environment where you are not expected to independently identify and resolve systemic issues or cross-team dependencies. Your career preference is to specialize deeply in only one area of the stack (pure frontend or pure backend) and not apply expertise across a full-stack context. You are unwilling to engage deeply at all technical levels, from strategic architecture down to the implementation details, to fully understand complex systems.

Use the principles as a practical guide to making decisions. We are what we repeatedly do. By living the principles outlined below, we will build an outstanding company and do insanely great work. Solve customer problems. It's our highest calling. Designing a product? Start from the customer problem it solves. Updating our sales process? Flip it around, and simplify the customer buying process. Think BIG! Start small. Great changes start with a first step. Find it. Take it. Build a system around what works. This is the secret to bringing a vision to life. Go and see with your own eyes. Meet the customer, use the product, talk to the field. Great systems aren't built from afar. Priorities: Choose one. Leaders give the gift of clarity. They find the most important thing and do it. Max power. Top speed. Danger zones: Bureaucracy. May the best ideas and execution win. Complexity. Leaders use frameworks and systems to simplify. No commitment. Leaders don't compromise just to get along. Debate. Disagree. But once a decision is made, commit. Leaving what's important unsaid or undone. No ""circling back."" Data informs. Insight transforms. Pull the thread. Ask why. Leaders are curious. They use what they learn to create clarity. Insist on excellence. Leaders set high standards and overcome obstacles. They do the kind of work they're excited to share with the world. Live off the land. Leaders creatively use resources already available to them &ndash; especially AI &ndash; to execute and automate their work. Good judgment. Leaders have it. Where it comes from: insight, listening, first-hand experience. How to apply it: carefully on big, hard to reverse decisions. Swiftly on limited, easy to reverse ones. Help others. Leaders know we're building this together.
