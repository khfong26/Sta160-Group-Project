We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future. To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets. #LongLiveDogs What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the best experience, every time. Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers (humans and their best friends) with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before. You'll support a group of talented engineers and managers across ""pawds"" who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to have a direct hand in scaling the business, solving novel customer problems, and building strong relationships along the way. If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you. One Team: We don't think of ourselves as ""Acquisition Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically. We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems. We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically. We Execute For Impact: We don't subscribe to ""best practices"" or ""industry KPIs"". We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience. We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption : We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, ""what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?"". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly.

We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future. To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the right experience, every time. Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before. You'll join a group of talented engineers and managers who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to help scale the business, solve novel customer problems, and build strong relationships along the way. If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you. One Team: We don't think of ourselves as ""Acquisition Marketers"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically. We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems. We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically. We Execute For Impact: We don't subscribe to ""best practices"" or ""industry KPIs"". We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience. We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption : We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, ""what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?"". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time. How You'll Make an Impact Lead the end-to-end lifecycle of complex systems and features, from planning through maintenance, ensuring long-term sustainability Improve team execution by refining processes, tools, and practices that raise the bar for everyone Collaborate with product managers, engineers, designers, and business stakeholders to shape strategy and achieve our goals Contribute to our engineering culture and mentor the team through knowledge sharing, feedback, and design and incident reviews Work our stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, OpenAPI, AWS), but embrace learning and applying new tools as needed We're Excited About You Because You lead by example and take full ownership over the success of the product, software and ""pawd"" (our name for cross-functional teams) You are curious and regularly seek out ways to improve both our system and how we work You lead projects with impact beyond just your pawd's domain and you bring others along You elevate others through mentorship, code reviews and clear feedback You welcome diverse opinions and actively seek input to challenge your assumptions You see the value in communicating key decisions, tradeoffs and practices through writing You are committed to furthering the mission of The Farmer's Dog Office Guidelines We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space.

We automatically find all the engineering lessons buried in codebases, code reviews, incident post-mortems, and Slack chats, and turn them into real-time guardrails that flag or fix risky patterns in coding agents and PRs, so that teams can ship faster and avoid disaster. We're building a small, diverse team of exceptional engineers who are excited about the future of agentic coding and care deeply about creating tools that make software development faster and more reliable. We're looking for meticulous, high-agency people who have good judgment around what problems to solve, the skills to build a great product around it, and the hunger to iterate towards better versions. About This Role: You'll be working across the stack, including our Typescript+React frontend, Python/Go backend, and LLM infrastructure. You should have a good intuition for the right tools to use, and how to configure, combine, and tweak them to deliver the best results for our users. You bias towards action, and eagerly jump on things (or assign an agent) ""now"" rather than ""later"" or ""tomorrow"". You say what you're going to do, and you do it (quickly). We work hybrid in-person in San Francisco (our office is in Mission Bay) and NYC, but are open to remote for strong candidates. Here's a guide to how we work. Responsibilities: Talk directly to users: understand their requirements, build what they ask for, ask for their feedback, follow up as needed, and iterate based on what they say. Craft delightful product interactions. Proactively identify and implement improvements to our product and foundations (e.g. propose improvements to our core product; add database indices to better serve a feature; build internal tooling to manage the user experience around a feature). Other things that may come up from time to time to move our company forward (or keep the lights on). Collaborate closely with teammates and share learnings openly &mdash; we value thoughtful discussion as much as rapid iteration. Share and promote your work publicly (e.g. on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc). What We Offer: Challenging work on enterprise-scale codebases and datasets. Unlimited token usage for development using Amp. High compensation (and a long runway). Employee-friendly equity terms (low FMV, early exercise, extended exercise). Your choice of Macbook Pro + computer/office equipment stipend. Health, dental, and vision insurance. A relatively un-chaotic working environment (we aren't pivoting every week). An opportunity to lead and define our company. Qualifications: Experience building 0 to 1 products, either as a founder, or early engineer at a funded startup. Hands-on experience with the latest AI models, with a strong intuition about model capabilities, the behavioral nuances of each, and how to prompt them to get the best results. Data science experience, especially around clustering and anomaly detection. Clear and thoughtful communication on technical and strategic topics: at this stage, you'll be helping build the foundations of our company. You should have ideas/opinions about almost everything we do, and you should be forthcoming with your thoughts (even if it means being disagreeable). Well-crafted, tastefully-design work examples. Bonus points: Experience working on programming language tooling: compilers/parsers/indexers (e.g. LLVM, tree-sitter, SCIP) or type systems (e.g. Typescript itself or Sorbet). We encourage you to apply even if you don't meet every qualification listed. We value potential, curiosity, and a willingness to learn as much as we value prior experience.
