Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry: ""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc). The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business. I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Build dashboards, KPIs, and insight loops that drive clarity for executives and operators. Shape company strategy through data-driven storytelling and forward-looking analysis. What You'll Bring: 10+ years across Data, AI/ML, or Intelligence leadership within SaaS, platform, or high-scale environments. Experience building unified data platforms, event-driven systems, and scalable insight layers. Deep technical fluency in data engineering, ML, distributed systems, and modern data stack patterns. Proven ability to ship AI or predictive products in partnership with Product & Engineering. Strong leadership presence able to align executives, influence partners, and drive cross-functional adoption. Clear, strategic thinking with a track record of simplifying complexity into action. A builder's mindset and bias for momentum; thrives in ambiguity and creates clarity through structure. Success Looks Like Within months, Bizee's data foundation is unified and reliable. Teams operate with clarity, dashboards are trusted, and data flows seamlessly into product, growth, operations, and finance.

TEAM OVERVIEW The Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence team in PRX applies advanced ML and GenAI to reduce the risk and cost of operating the firm's large-scale compute infrastructure and extensive application estate. Building on strengths in statistical modelling, anomaly detection, predictive modelling, and time-series forecasting, we leverage foundational LLM Models to orchestrate multi-agent systems for automated production management services. By unifying classical ML with agentic AI, we deliver reliable, explainable, and cost-efficient operations at scale. ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES In this role, you will be responsible for launching and implementing GenAI agentic solutions aimed at reducing the risk and cost of managing large-scale production environments with varying complexities. You will address various production runtime challenges by developing agentic AI solutions that can diagnose, reason, and take actions in production environments to improve productivity and address issues related to production support. What you'll do: Build agentic AI systems: Design and implement tool-calling agents that combine retrieval, structured reasoning, and secure action execution (function calling, change orchestration, policy enforcement) following MCP protocol. Engineer robust guardrails for safety, compliance, and least-privilege access. Productionize LLMs: Build evaluation framework for open-source and foundational LLMs; implement retrieval pipelines, prompt synthesis, response validation, and self-correction loops tailored to production operations. Integrate with runtime ecosystems: Connect agents to observability, incident management, and deployment systems to enable automated diagnostics, runbook execution, remediation, and post-incident summarization with full traceability. Collaborate directly with users: Partner with production engineers, and application teams to translate production pain points into agentic AI roadmaps; define objective functions linked to reliability, risk reduction, and cost; and deliver auditable, business-aligned outcomes. Safety, reliability, and governance: Build validator models, adversarial prompts, and policy checks into the stack; enforce deterministic fallbacks, circuit breakers, and rollback strategies; instrument continuous evaluations for usefulness, correctness, and risk. Scale and performance: Optimize cost and latency via prompt engineering, context management, caching, model routing, and distillation; leverage batching, streaming, and parallel tool-calls to meet stringent SLOs under real-world load. Build a RAG pipeline: Curate domain-knowledge; build data-quality validation framework; establish feedback loops and milestone framework maintain knowledge freshness.
