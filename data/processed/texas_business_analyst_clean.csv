Here's what an ex-McKinsey teammate has to say about joining Jerry: ""I've really enjoyed working at Jerry because it's allowed me to flex the strategy muscles I built at McKinsey while also getting much closer to implementation. Unlike traditional consulting, I'm not just handing off a recommendation &mdash; I actually get to own the metrics, design A/B tests, and see how our strategies play out in the real world. Jerry has a deeply data-driven culture. We A/B test everything, and there's been a big investment in data infrastructure &mdash; from clean, well-structured data to a strong data engineering team that supports real decision-making. As a result, the data and BizOps team is seen as a core strategic partner within the company. Another thing I've appreciated is the team itself. A lot of people here come from MBB, so I've still got the energy, sharp thinking, and high bar that I had at McKinsey &mdash; but now I also get to build, test, and iterate on the strategies I help develop. It's a great mix of ownership, rigor, and impact.""

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry: ""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc). The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business. I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work.

Since opening in October 2014, nine months ahead of the contracted completion date, the general highway lanes are experiencing a 70% decrease in congestion time and a 15% increase in average speed.

The project is operated and maintained by the Cintra-led consortium in North Texas. This project has improved mobility by adding additional road capacity through a combination of general highway lanes and continuous frontage roads, along with tolled express lanes that use variable pricing to keep traffic moving. The LBJ Express (LBJ) is currently the largest P3 operation in Texas and one of the largest ever undertaken in the U.S. It is a regionally-significant transportation improvement project in North Texas that is relieving severe congestion in the dense urban area of north Dallas. In 2009, the Cintra-led consortium was selected to complete the design, construction, finance, operation, and maintenance of the project along I-635 and I-35E.
