We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years &mdash; scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company's most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.).

We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries. Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry: ""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc). The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business. I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

Our systems operate at exabyte scale , processing petabytes of data each day for some of the world's most prominent enterprises in finance, technology, and industry. These systems are already making a measurable difference in how global organizations use data to deploy AI safely and efficiently. We believe that the next generation of enterprise AI will not come from larger models but from more efficient data systems . By advancing the frontier of how data is represented, stored, and transformed, we aim to make large-scale intelligence creation sustainable and adaptive. Our long-term vision is Efficient Intelligence : AI that learns using fewer resources, generalizes from less data, and reasons through structure rather than scale. To reach that, we are first building the Foundational Data Systems that make structured AI possible. The Role The Applied AI Research Team sits at the center of this mission. Your work will take the ideas emerging from fundamental research and turn them into practical algorithms, optimized pipelines, and production-ready systems that operate across petabytes of structured enterprise data. This is a high-ownership role for engineers who can think like researchers and build like systems experts. You will translate theory into measurable performance improvements and help define the foundations of structured AI. What You'll Do Turn research into real systems Transform foundational ideas from Granica Research and Prof. Andrea Montanari's group into scalable algorithms and experimental prototypes. Build the evaluation harnesses, metrics, and datasets that reveal real signal from research concepts. Define and refine the metrics that determine progress in structured AI. Invent and optimize algorithms for structured AI Develop efficient learning methods for relational, tabular, graph, and enterprise data. Prototype representation learning architectures and compression-aware models for large-scale structured information. Build high-performance learning pipelines Implement fast training and inference loops using PyTorch, JAX, or custom kernels. Optimize memory, compute, and data-movement paths with a focus on cost, latency, and throughput. Integrate symbolic, relational, and neural components Design hybrid learning systems that reason over structured data natively, not through text intermediaries. Collaborate deeply across teams Work with Research Scientists to validate hypotheses at scale. Work with Systems Engineers to integrate your algorithms into Granica's core data platform. Work with Product Engineering to ship features that power live enterprise workloads. Iterate fast and measure everything Run controlled experiments, analyze performance deltas, and deliver results with clear benchmarks. Drive the loop from prototype to production, improving the system each cycle. What You'll Bring Technical Depth Strong background in machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, or distributed learning. Experience building and tuning algorithms for structured, tabular, graph, or relational data. Ability to reason from first principles about efficiency, scaling behavior, and information flow. Systems Ability Hands-on experience with PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, or custom ML kernels. Strong Python skills and familiarity with systems languages such as Rust, C++, or CUDA. Experience with large-scale data pipelines, model evaluation frameworks, or distributed systems. Applied Mindset Demonstrated ability to turn theoretical concepts into performant, reliable code. Comfort working in ambiguous research environments while delivering measurable outcomes. Curiosity for how structure and efficiency reshape the next generation of AI. Bonus Experience Structured representation learning, tabular or multimodal models, or relational ML. Distributed data systems, query engines, or vector/embedding infrastructure. Open-source contributions or collaborative research bridging theory and production. Why This Role Matters The world's most valuable data is structured . The current form of AI is not. Your work will help close that gap. You will design the primitives that enable efficient learning at global scale and help build the foundations of structured AI. This role has real ownership, immediate impact, and a long horizon. Why Granica Fundamental Research Meets Enterprise Impact. Work at the intersection of science and engineering, turning foundational research into deployed systems serving enterprise workloads at exabyte scale. AI by Design. Build the infrastructure that defines how efficiently the world can create and apply intelligence. Real Ownership. Design primitives that will underpin the next decade of AI infrastructure. High-Trust Environment. Deep technical work, minimal bureaucracy, shared mission. Enduring Horizon. Backed by NEA, Bain Capital, and various luminaries from tech and business. We are building a generational company for decades, not quarters or a product cycle. Compensation & Benefits Competitive salary, meaningful equity, and substantial bonus for top performers Flexible time off plus comprehensive health coverage for you and your family Support for research, publication, and deep technical exploration Join us to build the foundational data systems that power the future of enterprise AI.
