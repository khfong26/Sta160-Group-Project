This position is not eligible for immigration sponsorship. About the Role and You We're looking for a rare combination: a data scientist who thinks like a strategist and a strategist who speaks fluent data. You fall in love with problems and quantify complex situations using math. This isn't a role about building models in isolation-it's about transforming how a business makes decisions, identifies opportunities, and drives growth. You'll be equal parts analyst, advisor, and architect of our strategic direction. What You'll Do You'll sit at the intersection of data and strategy, turning complex business challenges into quantifiable opportunities. This means diving deep into our numbers to surface insights that others miss, then translating those insights into actionable growth strategies. You'll work directly with leadership to shape major business decisions, from market expansion and pricing strategy to resource allocation and competitive positioning. Your day-to-day will involve identifying the right questions to ask before anyone else thinks to ask them, building the analytical frameworks to answer those questions, and presenting recommendations that fundamentally shift how we operate. You'll own strategic initiatives from conception through execution, measuring impact and iterating as you go. You'll travel to client sites as needed. What We're Looking For The Strategic Mindset: You naturally think several moves ahead. You understand business models, competitive dynamics, and growth levers. You can walk into a room with executives and hold your own in discussions about market strategy, unit economics, and long-term planning. You've seen how businesses succeed and fail, and you know how to spot the difference. The Technical Depth: You're genuinely strong in quantitative methods-statistics, predictive modeling, optimization, experimental design. You can wrangle messy data, build robust analyses, and know when a sophisticated model is needed versus when a simple calculation will do. Python, R, SQL are second nature to you. The Translation Layer: You can explain complex analytical concepts to non-technical stakeholders without dumbing them down. You know how to build conviction around data-driven recommendations and can defend your methodology when challenged. You make the quantitative accessible and actionable. The Business Acumen: You understand P&Ls, growth metrics, customer economics, and operational levers. You've worked closely enough with business teams to know what keeps them up at night and how your analyses can help them sleep better. Requirements 5+ years of experience in analytical roles with increasing strategic responsibility Strong foundation in statistics, machine learning, and quantitative analysis Demonstrated experience influencing business strategy through data Track record of identifying and driving growth opportunities Excellent communication skills with technical and executive audiences Proficiency in modern data science tools and languages Understanding of business finance and growth frameworks Ideal Background You might come from management consulting with deep analytical chops, strategic roles at high-growth companies, corporate strategy teams with hands-on data work, or data science roles where you've grown into strategic advisory. What matters most is that you've successfully used data to change how businesses operate and grow. What Success Looks Like In your first year, you'll have identified three major strategic opportunities we weren't seeing before, built the analytical infrastructure to evaluate them rigorously, and driven at least one to implementation with measurable business impact. You'll have become a trusted advisor to leadership and the person they turn to when facing the company's thorniest strategic questions. The annual salary for this role ranges from: $170,000 to $225,000 USD + benefits + bonus.

Sam Altman Should I start a company? Should I keep going with my startup? What problem should I solve? ""Starting by thinking up a problem is risky because you may invent a problem that doesn't truly exist. If you can't answer ['who wants this right now?'], then the idea is probably bad."" Paul Graham We believe the best thing you can do right now is join a breakout AI team, face real problems, work with potential co-founders, and make a lot of money. What are we building? We're solving the biggest problem in modern work: email. And we're doing it at the best possible time in history to solve it. Too many companies start out focused on what users love, then add bells and whistles no one needs, hide features behind paywalls, and lose sight of what made them great in the first place. We think the best user experiences come from focus. For us, that means AI-generated email drafts. We're laser-focused on making them better over time, using context from your meetings, inbox, and messages, because that's what matters most to our users. Unlike other startups, we're a pure-play applied AI company , not a SaaS tool with AI bolted on. We use the best techniques, including fine-tuned open-source models, tool use, and retrieval-augmented generation. As a result, users send 53% of the drafts we generate. How's it going? This year, we've grown from $1M to $25M ARR , with a technical team of just 12 (up from 2). We're forecasting $100M ARR by the end of 2026. We have product&ndash;market fit, and we take none of it for granted. We're relentlessly focused. There will be a $10B+ company in this space. It will be us if we stay focused. Ranked 7th in Andreessen Horowitz's list of top AI apps , based on real startup spend data. The other nine in the top 10 are valued at $10B+. Autonomy. Agency. Ownership. Team members own both product strategy (we have no product managers and no plans to add them) and the execution of that strategy. They decide when to bring in qualitative insights (interviews, surveys, etc.) or quantitative data, supported by our data engineering team. Our technical staff focus on: Building an incredible product Helping users find value and share Training cutting-edge models Developing scalable infrastructure We're deliberate about hiring. A small team of exceptional people, working hard on a problem they care about, will always beat a larger, less focused team.That intensity means this isn't a normal role, but it also means you'll move faster than anywhere else. Examples: Serafin joined 6 months ago and built our entire product notetaker, competing with whole companies, including research, model training, and product development. Joey joined 7 months ago and built our human data platform for model training and evals. Josh joined 14 months ago and now leads infrastructure, having built core products like scheduling along the way. What we promise Most fast-growing startups fall into traps: overhiring, losing focus, acting like big companies. We believe small, exceptional, high-performing teams are the future. No bureaucracy No processes that slow decisions No constant distractions, we have company-wide focus time with no meetings until 3pm A humble but extremely ambitious environment.

Today American infrastructure faces no shortage of challenges &mdash; from natural disaster risk and climate change to outright age and deterioration. The problem is that the way we design infrastructure is stuck in the past. Engineers today spend most of their time bogged down in documentation, clunky CAD software, and manual workflows &mdash; acting more like back-office admin than inventive builders. We're on a mission to change that. We're acquiring and partnering with the best engineering design firms &mdash; civil, structural, environmental, MEP, and more &mdash; to embed AI at the core of their operations and create the engineering firm of the future. About the role We're hiring Applied AI Engineers who will work directly with customer executives, operators, and technical teams to define and deliver high-impact AI systems. We don't build prototypes or laboratory projects- you'll design, build, and ship production-grade AI agents and workflows that drive millions in business value for customers. Our Applied AI Engineers: Shape the AI vision : Collaborate with customer stakeholders to define their long-term AI strategy and transformation roadmap. Identify high-leverage use cases : Work backwards from the long-term vision to surface and prioritize specific AI applications that connect our ambition to measurable business value. Ship real products : Rapidly build and deploy AI solutions that work in the wild, with real users and real data. Advance our core product : Encode the lessons from our customer engagements in our Eagle platform, consistently contributing new features, patterns, and abstractions. What we're looking for AI-nativeness: You're excited about the potential for AI to transform businesses and want to play a hands-on role in bringing frontier technology into critical institutions. Being generative and collaborative: You love constantly jamming on new ""what if"" ideas with teammates and partners. Extreme ownership : You're willing to jump in and love being the one on the hook. You aren't going to wait to be pointed at a task&mdash;you're going to identify what you think we should do next, and then do it. Execution excellence and speed : You can build stuff in messy environments and know how to get code written and shipped quickly. You can hold the balance of speed and quality and know when to push the pace vs. when to slow down. Customer-obsession and respect : You're motivated by understanding customer pain points and iterating directly with end users to deliver wins quickly. Bonus if you have Hands-on experience with LLM tooling (LangGraph, Mastra, Agents SDK, etc). Built and deployed production LLM-powered systems (tool use, RAG pipelines, multi-step agents, human-in-the-loop, etc). Strong technical foundations in Python/TypeScript, cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) and DevOps tooling. Prior startup or founding engineer experience, balancing craft, ownership, and speed.

We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future. To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets. #LongLiveDogs What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In We're looking for an experienced Senior Director of Analytics to work on Supply Chain & Operations and Product Development efforts to deliver on our promise of quality food and timely delivery of our subscription boxes to our customers. This role also enables removing blindspots in our food and the box journey to customer and enrich our understanding in the inputs to output metrics. You will be responsible for synthesizing a wide-variety of data sources by working with external and internal partners. You'll have the opportunity to build upon our existing foundation to take the foundation we have in place today and evolve it effectively with the business to ensure we continue to design seamless and deeply personalized experiences in the box journey.. In the role, you'll partner closely with groups across the business in Product, Engineering, CX, Operations, Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, Data Scientists and other Analysts to build a best-in-class experiment design and insight generation engine. We need a leader who can share an inspiring vision, execute by bringing everyone on to the execution path, bring clarity and momentum and work with internal and external partners to remove blindspots in product journey to customer. This is the competitive edge for DTC business. This helps build feedback loops to what future products to launch, calibrate existing recipes, personalize fulfillment, identify margin opportunities and improve stickiness of our product with customers. As we continue to grow operationally for new products, product lines, etc. we'd need more strategic leadership to understand intricacies and nuances with external partners as well One Team: We don't think of ourselves as ""Supply Chain Specialists"", ""Engineers"", ""Data Analysts"", or ""Product Managers"". Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically. We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems. We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically. We Execute For Impact: We don't subscribe to ""best practices"" or ""industry KPIs"". We're uninterested in how we compare to ""benchmarks""; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience. We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption : We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, ""what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?"". We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time. How You'll Make An Impact Define and execute the analytics vision, strategy, and roadmap for supply chain and product development, with clear goals, priorities, and stakeholder communication. Build, lead, and mentor a high-impact Analytics team, providing coaching, feedback, and career development to drive long-term success.

We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: ""Everyone's welcome at the dog park."" No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow. We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team. Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.

Why Achira Join a world-class team of researchers, scientists, and engineers unifying probabilistic AI/ML and molecular simulation to reimagine small molecule drug discovery. Advance new architectures for conditional 3D generation and learned proposal mechanisms informed by physical priors. Operate at the frontier scale of large models, large datasets, and high-throughput evaluation on an ML-framework&ndash;native biomolecular simulation stack. Own impact end-to-end from model conception to sampler design to prospective design tools. Work in a culture that rewards rigor, speed, and scientific depth with an ownership mindset. About the Role Achira is building foundation simulation models and conditional generators for molecular systems. You will design probabilistic generative models (utilizing strategies such as diffusion models, normalizing flows, and flow matching) that that exploit Achira's next-generation biomolecular simulation potentials. Your work will enable target- and property-conditioned small-molecule generation and efficient exploration of biomolecular conformational landscapes, driving measurable gains in efficiency for small molecule design. Familiarity with statistical mechanics&mdash;particularly nonequilibrium statistical mechanics based on Crooks/Jarzynski viewpoints&mdash;is desirable, but the center of gravity is probabilistic AI/ML. What You'll Do Develop conditional molecular generators: Build conditional small-molecule generators (e.g., pocket/scaffold/pharmacophore- and property-conditioned) using generative modeling strategies such as diffusion models, normalizing flows, and flow matching with 3D- and symmetry-aware representations. Develop efficient samplers: Develop sequential sampling pipelines (e.g. SMC/AIS/tempering/Boltzmann generators) that anneal from learned priors into probabilities induced by Achira's ML potentials, maximizing ESS and reducing bias/variance. Couple learning and sampling: Design learned proposal mechanisms (transport maps, score-guided moves) that adapt to stiff, multimodal landscapes and improve mixing and wall-clock efficiency. Leverage nonequilibrium statistical mechanics: Where beneficial, use nonequilibrium switching protocols and work-based estimators to accelerate exploration and estimate partition-function ratios/affinity proxies. Measure what matters: Define and track relevant metrics (ESS/compute, acceptance probabilities) and build reliable evaluation harnesses for fast, physics-informed feedback. Experiment and engineer for reproducibility: Collaborate with our engineering team to implement robust research software in Python (PyTorch and/or JAX), with tests, CI, experiment tracking, and clear documentation. Collaborate closely: Partner with computational chemistry, AI/ML, and platform teams to shape objectives (potency, selectivity, developability) and run prospective design studies. Automate workflows: Use generative coding and experiment-management tools to accelerate iteration and close active-learning loops with synthetic data generation in the loop. About You Probabilistic ML background: Deep grasp of probabilistic machine learning, Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational inference, diffusion models, normalizing flows, flow matching, and uncertainty quantification. Sequential methods expert: Experience with sequential Monte Carlo methods, proposal design, and diagnostics for high-dimensional, multimodal targets. Geometric intuition: Comfort with graph/point-cloud/SE(3)-aware models and constraints relevant to protein&ndash;ligand systems and conformer generation. Systems thinker: You integrate models into end-to-end pipelines (data model sampler physics-aware evaluation candidate triage) and care about measurable impact. Familiarity with statistical mechanics(nice to have): Working knowledge of statistical mechanics, sampling, estimators, and the Crooks/Jarzynski perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics will be a superpower. Engineering discipline: Strong Python skills with PyTorch and/or JAX, Git/CI/testing, and reproducible experiment management. Mindset: You value rigor, move with urgency, collaborate well, and enjoy turning ideas into reliable, high-impact tools. Minimum Qualifications PhD (or equivalent research experience) in computer science, statistics, applied math, computational chemistry/biology, or related field. Demonstrated track record in probabilistic ML and generative modeling (publications, impactful open-source, or deployed systems). Industry experience tackling practical machine learning problems. Hands-on experience with diffusion/flows/flow matching on structured or geometric data. Practical experience with sequential Monte Carlo/AIS/tempering and/or advanced MCMC. Proficiency in Python with PyTorch and/or JAX; strong software engineering hygiene. Familiarity with biomolecular structure and data representations (graphs/3D/SMILES). Preferred Qualifications Experience with ML interatomic/energy potentials is a bonus Background in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, geometric deep learning, or score matching on manifolds. Experience with active learning / Bayesian optimization or RL-style acquisition for proposal selection. Experience with implementing MCMC sampling approaches grounded in statistical mechanics&mdash;especially nonequilibrium approaches that utilize Crooks/Jarzynski&mdash;a plus. Contributions to open-source scientific software; experience mentoring or leading small research efforts.
