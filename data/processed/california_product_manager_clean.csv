We use the best cloud-native and AI-enabled tools, and apply a battle-tested combination of Agile, Lean, and design thinking to collaboratively solve our client's most pressing challenges - and do it right the first time. We often work in regulated industries, such as healthcare, financial services, government and education. Our work helps detect diseases, identify kids who need special educational support, applies AI to support complex legal settlements, helps people access mental health services, and so much more. The Role As a Product Manager, you'll lead cross-functional software teams from discovery through launch and iteration. The work will span from modernizations and stabilizing ""project rescues"" to developing exciting new products. A significant portion of our work involves cutting-edge AI and data initiatives, including AI-native and enabled product experiences, data platform and integration work, and analytics/automation that turn insights into impact. You'll keep scope, schedule, budget, risk, and quality in balance while keeping clients confident and informed. What You'll Do Manage end-to-end delivery across multiple engagements, agile ceremonies, roadmaps, and iterative releases with measurable outcomes. Meet regularly with clients representing our team, so strong client-facing skills are essential. Translate business objectives into clear requirements and acceptance criteria; ensure tickets are unambiguous and testable. Demonstrated ability to produce logic (truth tables, etc). Keep abreast of the rapidly developing use and deployment of AI tools and techniques, and collaborate with your team and company leadership to integrate this knowledge into our approach. Coordinate across disciplines to ensure data readiness, evaluate and integrate AI model outputs, and ensure alignment with explainability, trust, and governance practices. Plan and track work (milestones, risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies), budgets, and delivery signals (e.g., burnup/burndown, velocity). Mitigate risks proactively; lead issue triage and escalation paths. Coordinate the day-to-day work of our engineers, designers, and product leaders, and work with client partners to ensure seamless collaboration and quality delivery. Partner with account leaders to manage scope and client expectations (draft SOWs, identify scope changes, identify opportunities for growth, escalate issues, validate invoices, etc.). Willing to do what is needed to help the company succeed. Partner with company leadership to help draft new business proposals, RFPs, and participate in new business pitches. What You'll Bring 4+ years of software product management / development experience or in a related role in a consultancy/agency or product organization delivering custom software.

The ability to understand the client's real goals and constraints in order to focus your team on identifying opportunities and unlocking business value. The ability to rapidly understand new business models and product ideas. Strong command of agile delivery (usually Scrum or Kanban), while being flexible to the requirements of our clients.

Technical fluency, including familiarity with common tools and technology stacks; comfortable collaborating with engineering leads. Design fluency , including design thinking, rapid prototyping, UX, and familiarity with common tools (e.g., Figma); comfortable collaborating with product and design leads. Experience coordinating with cross-functional teams (engineering, design, business), including distributed collaborators. Exposure to regulated domains (e.g., healthtech, fintech, govtech, edtech) is a plus. Excellent written communication skills . Using AI is great, but you know how to make sure outputs say what you actually mean them to say, with clarity and good taste. This means you could do it yourself, independent of AI. The ideal candidate probably has prior, hands-on experience as a software/data engineer, UX/UI designer, or product manager embedded in a software development team. How We Work (and what you can expect) Small, senior teams; zero big reveals: frequent demos, transparent progress, tight feedback loops.

If we're successful, we'll make it easier and faster to build critical physical infrastructure - roads, bridges, utilities, data centers, housing, etc. For decades, construction and field services contractors have had to run their businesses on outdated software: clunky, on-premise systems created in the 1980s and 1990s. That's where Miter comes in. We're using AI and embedded payments to rebuild the core HR, finance, and operations systems that underpin our physical economy. Using Miter, contractors like Marathon Electrical, W.J. O'Neil, and Truebeck Construction are building stronger teams, controlling job costs, and accelerating jobsite execution. This idea is resonating. Since we launched in 2022, we've grown to thousands of customers and tens of millions in ARR, making us one of the fastest growing vertical software companies ever. To double-down on our momentum, we've raised $50M+ from top investors (Bessemer, Coatue, and Battery) who share our belief that we're just getting started. Hybrid vs. Remote Approach: We believe the magic of Miter comes from working side by side. We also believe in work flexibility. For roles that are listed as hybrid, our approach is&mdash;three days a week in the office&mdash;giving us the chance to connect, brainstorm, and build stronger relationships. If you live within a reasonable commute to either our New York City or San Francisco offices, we ask that you work in our hybrid approach.

If we're successful, we'll make it easier and faster to build critical physical infrastructure - roads, bridges, utilities, data centers, housing, etc. For decades, construction and field services contractors have had to run their businesses on outdated software: clunky, on-premise systems created in the 1980s and 1990s. That's where Miter comes in. We're using AI and embedded payments to rebuild the core HR, finance, and operations systems that underpin our physical economy. Using Miter, contractors like Marathon Electrical, W.J. O'Neil, and Truebeck Construction are building stronger teams, controlling job costs, and accelerating jobsite execution. This idea is resonating. Since we launched in 2022, we've grown to thousands of customers and tens of millions in ARR, making us one of the fastest growing vertical software companies ever. To double-down on our momentum, we've raised $50M+ from top investors (Bessemer, Coatue, and Battery) who share our belief that we're just getting started. Hybrid vs. Remote Approach: We believe the magic of Miter comes from working side by side. We also believe in work flexibility. For roles that are listed as hybrid, our approach is&mdash;three days a week in the office&mdash;giving us the chance to connect, brainstorm, and build stronger relationships. If you live within a reasonable commute to either our New York City or San Francisco offices, we ask that you work in our hybrid approach. Otherwise, for roles listed as remote or in other cities where we don't have an office location, there is no requirement to work in our hybrid approach. We do travel a few times a year for onboarding, company wide, and team specific offsites! About the Team & How We Work: As the PM for our Platform team, you'll be responsible for the infrastructure, services, and developer experience that empower all of Miter's product teams to build better features, faster. You'll think in primitives: notifications, permissions, custom reporting, tasks and create the reusable building blocks that unlock product velocity and consistency across Miter. We care about clarity, speed, and craftsmanship. You'll work closely with engineering and design to build elegant, reliable systems that scale. What You'll Do: Own Miter's shared services: Lead the vision and roadmap for our core platform systems: Notifications, Permissions, Custom Reporting, Tasks, and other cross-cutting utilities. Build for leverage: Design abstractions, frameworks, and shared components that enable faster, more consistent product development across teams. Collaborate deeply with internal teams: Partner with product and engineering leads across Payroll, HR, Field Ops, and Spend to understand their needs and translate them into scalable platform capabilities. Prioritize reliability and usability: Balance performance, flexibility, and developer experience. You'll define clear contracts and standards for how Miter's product surfaces interact with shared infrastructure. Drive technical strategy: Work with engineering to evolve our platform architecture, ensuring services are modular, observable, and easy to extend. Establish a platform mindset: Build a culture where internal platform quality is treated with the same care as customer-facing features. What You'll Need: 4+ years of product management experience, ideally building platforms, APIs, or developer-facing systems. Strong technical fluency: you can discuss architecture, data models, and integration patterns with engineers confidently. A product mindset rooted in developer empathy: you love building systems that make other teams faster and more effective. Experience defining shared services or primitives that multiple product teams depend on (notifications, permissions, reporting frameworks, etc.). Excellent communication and alignment skills: you thrive on clarifying complexity across many stakeholders. A bias for structure and clarity: you think in systems, patterns, and long-term maintainability. Bonus Points: You can code! Familiarity with MongoDB and modern data pipelines (e.g., Snowflake or dbt). Exposure to role-based access control (RBAC), audit logging, or reporting frameworks.

Let's face it: designing, launching, and managing infrastructure is still a terrible experience for most organizations, but it doesn't have to be that way! We are globally recognized both for our open source tools (Terragrunt, Terratest, cloud-nuke) used by thousands of companies from startups to Fortune 500s, and our thought leadership on how DevOps should be done. Our commercial offerings include: Gruntwork AWS Accelerator: An opinionated, best-practices solution that accelerates a company's journey to a secure, compliant, and well-architected IaC setup on AWS. Terragrunt Scale: A suite of enterprise-grade tools including our IaC Pipeline, Patcher, and Drift Detection to help organizations manage IaC at scale Gruntwork is a profitable, bootstrapped company without any outside investors. We operate as a lean, capital efficient startup and our team is made up of values-aligned, hard-working and independently capable individuals. About this role Gruntwork presents the perfect opportunity for the experienced product lead to scale an OSS PLG product. Terragrunt has huge adoption (hundreds of thousands of developers), significant positive brand equity, and has had minimal to no commercialization to date. We're aiming to build a collaborative and respectful commercial motion around the product. If you've seen this pattern before and similarly see the potential, this could be the perfect opportunity for you. We are seeking a strategic, hands-on Head of Product to own the unified vision and execution for our product management (and to an extent, product marketing) functions. This is not a management and delegation role, this is a in-the-weeds product role with both strategic and operational components. You'll be working directly with open source users, open source community contributors and our in-house R&D team to build the future of DevOps. Responsibilities Product Strategy AND Product Execution You're the companies product person for the near term, that means you operate at all levels of the product stack. Define and own the company's product vision, strategy, and roadmap, ensuring tight alignment with our overall business goals and fundraising narrative. Collaborate with the CEO and engineering leadership to translate the company vision into a clear, prioritized roadmap for both the AWS Accelerator and Terragrunt Scale. Lead market research and customer discovery to sharpen our products' value proposition,s focusing on specific, high-pain use cases like security and compliance frameworks (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP). Spearhead the ideation and prototyping of a future AI-powered offering that leverages our unique data and expertise in the IaC space. Product Marketing The company does not, for now, have a dedicated product marketing headcount, so that responsibility primarily will fall with the product lead, to be shared with our head of marketing. Design, implement, and own the company's PLG strategy, creating seamless and intuitive pathways for open-source users to discover, try, and buy our commercial products. Develop compelling product positioning, messaging, and go-to-market strategies that resonate deeply with our technical audience, from individual developers to enterprise decision-makers. Mastermind our partnership and ecosystem strategy, with a heavy focus on leveraging the AWS Marketplace, co-selling with AWS, and building relationships with key ISVs. Own product pricing, packaging, and lifecycle management for all commercial offerings. Developer Relations & Community We have several developers who work everyday with the Terragrunt, Terratest, Opentofu (and other) open source communities. You're job is to make sure that our product strategy is supportive of, and remains sensitive and empathetic to the concerns and priorities of open source. Nurture and grow the vibrant communities around Terragrunt and OpenTofu, ensuring Gruntwork remains a trusted, authentic, and respected leader in the space. Act as the ""voice of the community"" internally, channeling user feedback, pain points, and insights directly into the product development process. Empower the developer community through world-class documentation, examples, tutorials, and content that showcases the power of our entire ecosystem (open source and commercial).

You live and breathe the developer user journey. Is a strategic thinker & gifted storyteller: You can zoom out to see the big picture and craft a compelling, simple narrative, but you can also zoom in to obsess over the details of a user flow.

The ""Doer"" Filter: The process is front-loaded to identify candidates who excel at writing PRD and talking to customers Asynchronous Respect: Since we are a remote-first, written-culture company, a portion of the process will involve written communication. After you apply for this role, here's the process we'll go through to evaluate a mutual fit: Phone screen: We'll do a quick phone screen to assess a general fit. The Product Builder Screen: We're looking to make sure you're comfortable being ""in the weeds"" building product. Technical Deep Dive: Validating technical fluency and end user (developer, architect) empathy. Messaging Deep Dive: Chat with our head of marketing and sales about the product marketing elements of the role Take Home: We'll ask you to think a bit about a product strategy problem anddraft some thoughts process on a real-world Gruntwork problem.

We'll ask your prior colleagues about where you thrive most. Offer! We're very pleased to be working together!
