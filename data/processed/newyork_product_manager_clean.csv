Today American infrastructure faces no shortage of challenges &mdash; from natural disaster risk and climate change to outright age and deterioration. The problem is that the way we design infrastructure is stuck in the past. Engineers today spend most of their time bogged down in documentation, clunky CAD software, and manual workflows &mdash; acting more like back-office admin than inventive builders. We're on a mission to change that. We're acquiring and partnering with the best engineering design firms &mdash; civil, structural, environmental, MEP, and more &mdash; to embed AI at the core of their operations and create the engineering firm of the future. About the Role As an Embedded Product Manager (EPM) at Eagle, you will collaborate with a team of engineers and researchers to define how a company reinvents themselves with AI. EPMs shape AI transformation strategies that executives can believe in, teams are excited by, and that can create outsized value. We care deeply about delivering real outcomes: ensuring that products are adopted, loved and scaled, without shying away from the complexity of real data and real users. We are creative problem solvers and relentlessly practical: we continuously iterate towards finding the right long-term and short-term tradeoffs, running experiments to validate value and understanding when to leverage our research team for when we need to push the envelope. As an early EPM team member you'll play a huge part in shaping which customers we target, the product abstractions we invest in and the culture of how we build together. Responsibilities This is a lead role with outsized responsibility. The work will range from shaping and executing the AI vision of a engineering firm to directing a team of world-class researchers.

Work backwards from the long-term vision to prioritize specific use cases that connect our ambition to immediate business value. Deliver high value workflows by leveraging partners and building greenfield products. Design high-value workflows with our engineers and researchers. Iterate quickly based on user feedback and partner closely with stakeholders to ensure what we build is loved and trusted. Create systems to quantify the impact of our work and tie to top-level business impact Translate learnings into reusable playbooks that help us drive faster change with future customers.
