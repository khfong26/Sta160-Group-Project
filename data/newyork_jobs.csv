At the heart of our company is a belief in the power of in-person collaboration. Being together in the office fuels our creativity, strengthens our connections, and drives the innovation that sets us apart.

This role is expected to be in the office 5 days a week.</p>
<p>
The job conditions for this position are in a standard office setting. Employees in this position use PC and phone on an on-going basis throughout the day. Limited corporate travel may be required to remote offices or other business meetings and events.</p><br>

<p>
We are consistently recognized as a Best Place to Work and our culture is at the heart of our success. It's our fundamental belief that people do and create great things and that people are the cornerstone of prosperity. We believe that proactively seeking out different points of view, listening to others, learning, and reflecting on what we've heard creates a sense of belonging within PitchBook and strengthens the PitchBook community.</p><br>

<p>
The Farmer's Dog was born from a mission to change the landscape of pet health, providing dogs and their humans with honest, smart, and simple care. We're starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers' doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.</p>
<p>
To date, The Farmer's Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions,</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
What We Stand For and Where You'll Come In</b></h2>
<p>
At The Farmer's Dog, we believe the best customer experience comes from owning the technology that powers it. That's why we design, build, and operate our systems in-house, from subscription and e-commerce to fulfillment and delivery, so that every dog and human gets the right experience, every time.</p>
<p>
Our engineers work on problems that matter and that are hard: evolving systems to support rapid growth, building platforms flexible enough to serve customers with many different needs, and creating product experiences that didn't exist before.</p>
<p>
You'll join a group of talented engineers and managers who care deeply about building reliable, scalable systems and about working well together. Here, you'll have the space and agency to help scale the business, solve novel customer problems, and build strong relationships along the way.</p>
<p>
If you want to make an outsized impact on technology, on customers, and on the lives of dogs everywhere this is the right place for you.</p>
<p><b>
One Team:</b> We don't think of ourselves as &quot;Acquisition Marketers&quot;, &quot;Engineers&quot;, &quot;Data Analysts&quot;, or &quot;Product Managers&quot;. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don't think departments matter. We'd rather align ourselves to the goals we're working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems TOGETHER &ndash; getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms/Zooms to solve problems holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing:</b> Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren't tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there's a better or more impactful way to solve problems.</p>
<p><b>
We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions:</b> We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.</p>
<p><b>
We Execute For Impact:</b> We don't subscribe to &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;industry KPIs&quot;. We're uninterested in how we compare to &quot;benchmarks&quot;; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don't subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles &ndash; i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.</p>
<p><b>
We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption</b>: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, &quot;what's the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?&quot;. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don't expect to be perfect the first time.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
How You'll Make an Impact</b></h2>

<li>You elevate others through mentorship, code reviews and clear feedback</li>
<li>You welcome diverse opinions and actively seek input to challenge your assumptions</li>
<li>You see the value in communicating key decisions, tradeoffs and practices through writing</li>
<li>You are committed to furthering the mission of The Farmer's Dog</li>
</ul><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>Office Guidelines</b></h2>
<p>
We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.</p>
<h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Our Belonging Philosophy:</b></h2>
<p>
At TFD, we believe Belonging is a shared commitment to creating a workplace where every person feels respected, valued, and empowered to be themselves. When people feel a true sense of belonging, they do their best work, take smart risks, and bring forward diverse perspectives &mdash; leading to stronger decisions and deeper relationships.<br>
We anchor this belief in a simple phrase: &quot;Everyone's welcome at the dog park.&quot; No matter your background, identity, or role, there's space for you here. There's no one way to show up at the dog park&mdash; just shared space, mutual respect, and the freedom to be yourself. Being included is just the beginning, it's about contributing your voice, growing through challenges, and building trust through shared goals. This philosophy guides how we lead, how we hire, how we communicate, and how we grow.<br>
<br>
We continuously evaluate to ensure we are creating a consistent experience that cultivates belonging for all employees, from hiring and performance reviews to talent development. We also believe Belonging happens in everyday moments of connection; lunch with a new teammate, a shared laugh, or a quick story about your weekend. Our structure includes biannual employee surveys, manager training, TFD camps, and support from Humans to ensure we're listening and learning from our Team.</p>
<p>
Together, these efforts reflect what Belonging means at TFD: a culture where everyone can thrive.</p>

After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn&rsquo;t work together.<br>
<br>
So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions &ndash; to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we&rsquo;ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.<br>
<br>
Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes &ndash; large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us.

<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h3 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>

Valon is building the AI-native operating system for regulated finance, starting with mortgage servicing.<br>
<br>
We're a Series C company backed by a16z, transforming industries that others have written off as too complex to innovate.<br>
<br>
Rather than build on top of broken legacy systems, we took a different approach: we built and operate our own mortgage servicing business managing $110+ billion in loans. This wasn't the end goal, it was how we deeply understood the complexity needed to build software that actually works in regulated industries.<br>
<br>
The results speak for themselves. We've transformed mortgage servicing from a 0% margin business into 60%+ margins while dramatically improving customer experience. Major enterprise contracts are now deploying across the industry.<br>
<br>
ValonOS is our unified platform that makes every process structured and programmable and it is perfectly positioned for the AI era. When everything flows through one system with rich data, AI agents don't just automate tasks, they continuously improve entire operations. Mortgage servicing is just the beginning of our vision to transform regulated industries and beyond.</p><p></p><h2 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>
Engineering at Valon</b></h2><p>
Our engineering team is here to power the software ecosystem to disrupt one of the most outdated and regulated spaces in the financial sector - the mortgage industry. We&rsquo;ve built out the foundation of a modern mortgage servicing platform that can accurately handle billions of dollars at scale, but we&rsquo;re just getting started. At Valon, we want you to do the best work of your life. You'll be surrounded by a tight-knit community of exceptional people from places like Stripe, Jane Street, Meta, and Google who care deeply about their work and each other. Our problem space is complex, but you&rsquo;ll get a lot of autonomy so that you can learn quickly, execute effectively, and deliver the highest level of business impact.</p><p>

Be Humble</b></p><p>
Humility is our key to personal and professional growth. We appreciate that great ideas can come from anywhere, regardless of seniority, pedigree, or experience. We care more about collective outcomes than who gets credit or who does what. We try to not let our ego cloud our judgment.</p><p><b>
Win Together</b></p><p>
Winning is no accident. It is the result of collective hard work, perseverance, sacrifice, and most of all, loving what we do. Winning requires that we give extra&mdash;sometimes winning calls for late nights or extra effort, and we show up for clients and each other with urgency and heart. While excellence is a journey, winning is a destination.</p><p></p><p><i>

CB Insights Leadership Principles</b></p>
<p>
At CB Insights, everyone is expected to be a leader. These leadership principles are like an operating system for our culture. Use the principles as a practical guide to making decisions.
<br>
We are what we repeatedly do. By living the principles outlined below, we will build an outstanding company and do insanely great work.</p>
<div>
<ul><li><b>Solve customer problems. </b>It's our highest calling. Designing a product? Start from the customer problem it solves. Updating our sales process? Flip it around, and simplify the customer buying process.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Think BIG! Start small. </b>Great changes start with a first step. Find it. Take it. Build a system around what works. This is the secret to bringing a vision to life.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Go and see with your own eyes. </b>Meet the customer, use the product, talk to the field. Great systems aren't built from afar.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Priorities: Choose one. </b>Leaders give the gift of clarity. They find the most important thing and do it. Max power. Top speed.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Danger zones:</b>
<ul><li><b>Bureaucracy.</b> May the best ideas and execution win.</li>
<li><b>Complexity.</b> Leaders use frameworks and systems to simplify.</li>
<li><b>No commitment.</b> Leaders don't compromise just to get along. Debate. Disagree. But once a decision is made, commit.</li>
<li><b>Leaving what's important unsaid or undone.</b> No &quot;circling back.&quot;</li>
</ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Data informs. Insight transforms. </b>Pull the thread. Ask why. Leaders are curious. They use what they learn to create clarity.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Insist on excellence. </b>Leaders set high standards and overcome obstacles. They do the kind of work they're excited to share with the world.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Live off the land. </b>Leaders creatively use resources already available to them &ndash; especially AI &ndash; to execute and automate their work.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Good judgment. Leaders have it. </b>Where it comes from: insight, listening, first-hand experience. How to apply it: carefully on big, hard to reverse decisions. Swiftly on limited, easy to reverse ones.</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Help others. </b>Leaders know we're building this together.</li></ul>

About the team<br>
The Sponsored Products and Brands team at Amazon Ads is re-imagining the advertising landscape through the latest generative AI technologies, revolutionizing how millions of customers discover products and engage with brands across Amazon.com and beyond. We are at the forefront of re-inventing advertising experiences, bridging human creativity with artificial intelligence to transform every aspect of the advertising lifecycle from ad creation and optimization to performance analysis and customer insights.<br>

The Autonomous Campaigns team within Sponsored Products and Brands is focused on guiding and supporting 1.6MM advertisers to meet their advertising needs of creating and managing ad campaigns. At this scale, the complexity of diverse advertiser goals, campaign types, and market dynamics creates both a massive technical challenge and a transformative opportunity: even small improvements in guidance systems can have outsized impact on advertiser success and Amazon&rsquo;s retail ecosystem.<br>
Our vision is to build a highly personalized, context-aware campaign creation and management system that leverages LLMs together with tools such as auction simulations, ML models, and optimization algorithms. This agentic framework, will operate across both chat and non-chat experiences in the ad console, scaling to natural language queries as well as proactively delivering guidance based on deep understanding of the advertiser. To execute this vision, we collaborate closely with stakeholders across Ad Console, Sales, and Marketing to identify opportunities&mdash;from high-level product guidance down to granular keyword recommendations&mdash;and deliver them through a tailored, personalized experience.
